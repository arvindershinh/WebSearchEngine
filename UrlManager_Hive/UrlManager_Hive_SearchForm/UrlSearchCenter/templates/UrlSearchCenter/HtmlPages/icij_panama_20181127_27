in nigeria. the government claims the yacht was bought with profits from crude oil sales that were diverted and never paid to authorities. the galactica star\xe2\x80\x99s owner is kolawole aluko a petroleum and aviation mogul who is one of four defendants accused of helping to cheat nigeria out of <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/313814683/untitled#from_embed">nearly $1.8 billion owed</a> to the government on massive sales of oil. in a separate investigation nigerian authorities are also reportedly probing whether aluko <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/nigeria-oil-idukl8n1261pw20151006">helped smuggle</a> millions of dollars out of the country as kickbacks to nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s former petroleum minister diezani

panama-headquartered law firm with offices around the world worked for three former nigerian oil ministers who used companies to buy boats and homes in london the records show. the prevalence of nigerians within the panama papers may be no coincidence. nigeria loses more money from illicit activity including graft and corporate tax abuse than any other african nation research by anti-corruption groups indicates. as much as 12 percent of nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s annual gross domestic product is <a

wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d in october 2015 london police questioned alison-madueke nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s oil minister from 2010 to 2015 as part of investigations into allegations of bribery and money laundering. the investigations are ongoing. the ex-minister who graduated with an architecture degree from howard university in washington d.c. in 1992 is in london undergoing cancer treatment her lawyers said in a <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2015/10/08/diezani-alison-madueke-stricken-cancer-her-lawyer-says">public statement</a>. media reports have described aluko as a key ally to alison-madueke a relationship both have previously denied. he rose to prominence around 2011 when nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s government awarded two companies he founded or owned valuable oil blocks on a no-bid basis. one of his companies atlantic energy was created the day before it inked the deals to acquire multimillion-dollar oil licenses.  aluko is part of a circle of oil traders who are the subject of frequent media speculation in nigeria. his lifestyle has earned him the reputation of being nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s playboy. he bought an apartment in manhattan for $8.6 million and according to the new york times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/us/shell-company-bel-air-mansion.html _r=1">paid more than $70 million</a> to buy four homes in santa barbara and beverly hills.  the nigerian government won a court order in may freezing assets linked to aluko two companies he directed and one of his business partners. the lagos high court order listed aluko\xe2\x80\x99s yacht along with property in london four homes in california two penthouses in manhattan one in dubai 132 houses and apartments in nigeria and land in canada and switzerland. the court also ordered aluko not to sell or dispose of more than $67 million in four bank accounts in london and switzerland an assortment of watches a 58-car collection and three airplanes. through a representative aluko told icij that \xe2\x80\x9ci have never been prosecuted and convicted in any country. i am aware that a criminal investigation was started in the uk. however to date i have not been made aware of any law enforcement action to be undertaken against me.\xe2\x80\x9d aluko told icij that the information relating to the award of oil contracts to his company was \xe2\x80\x9cmisguided\xe2\x80\x9d speculation. \xe2\x80\x9cas a private citizen i organise my business and family matters to maximise convenience as well as operational and administrative efficiency. my companies operate in accordance with the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdictions and insofar tax liabilities arise they pay taxes in the jurisdictions in which taxes are due to be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d criminal charges for alleged crude oil fraud against aluko were dropped in july as a result according to media reports of authorities\xe2\x80\x99 inability to locate and serve legal documents on the swiss resident.

offshore havens. he was director of another fragola ltd in the seychelles. in may 2013 aluko paid $11.05 million to buy <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10120332">almaty united investors

paper by a succession of three companies in nevis switzerland and the bvi financial hubs prized for their secrecy. the company was incorporated three weeks after alison-madueke was appointed to head the ministry of petroleum resources in april 2010.  in march 2014 earnshaw associates registered a bombardier global express jet in malta  according to documents sent through mossack fonseca. the 18-seat bombardier is the same model of aircraft that nigerian media reported alison-madueke used during her time in office. long before aluko mossack fonseca had faced questions about its nigerian customers. in 2007 when the firm\xe2\x80\x99s employees realized that an offshore company was being used by a former advisor to olusegun obasanjo nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s president from 1999 to 2007 j\xc3\xbcrgen mossack reminded his staff that \xe2\x80\x9cin this firm everyone knows that dealing with nigerians always gives you headaches. it\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable that this case involves a crime or fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d other suspect nigerian deals seemed to have passed unnoticed. one crude oil sale contract between three offshore companies for example provided for commissions so high that one expert consulted by icij said the most obvious explanation is that the oil was stolen. another file is a $12 million loan from a shell company to a nigerian typed on half a sheet of paper. \xe2\x80\x9ci had to sign dozens of pages of paperwork for my home loan\xe2\x80\x9d said aaron sayne a financial crimes lawyer and expert witness in dozens of oil fraud cases in nigeria after looking

minister until 1998. his tenure became the subject of investigations after he left office. he was convicted in france of <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21579469-court-documents-shed-light-manoeuvrings-shell-and-eni-win-huge-nigerian-oil-block">money laundering</a> and authorities in three countries <a

company linked to etete were transferred or pocketed as bribes by political figures and middlemen.   the panama papers reveal that etete and the company malabu oil &  gas limited signed a <a

who had burst onto the scene and secured a string of oil licenses from minister alison-madueke\xe2\x80\x99s office with startling ease. in 2011 and 2012 aluko\xe2\x80\x99s atlantic energy which boasted of \xe2\x80\x9cstrong government relationships\xe2\x80\x9d grabbed eight crude oil licenses in the western niger delta. atlantic sent tens of millions of dollars of crude oil to italy the united states germany the netherlands and elsewhere throughout 2012 and 2013 according to documents seen by icij. in september 2014 however rumors floated in nigerian media suggested that aluko and his companies had fallen out of favor with alison-madueke. by september atlantic defaulted on its loans and owed nigeria $1.3 billion in cash and other obligations. the nigerian government and banks sent out confidential pleas to would-be angel investors in the hope they would be willing to step in with $700 million and fill the hole left by atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy. two months later mossack fonseca employees doing a routine background check on aluko discovered online news articles claiming that nigerian authorities might ask interpol the world\xe2\x80\x99s police body to help extradite the magnate.  interpol has denied it ever sought the nigerian. and while the internet chatter was enough to spook some of mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s employees the firm remained at aluko\xe2\x80\x99s service.  it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until june 2015 that mossack fonseca took a second look at aluko after it received a demand from the british virgin islands financial investigation agency to produce documents about earnshaw associates.  mossack fonseca told bvi authorities that \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not have information about any bank accounts or assets held by\xe2\x80\x9d earnshaw despite having signed documents more than a year earlier to help aluko\xe2\x80\x99s company register a private jet.  in august 2015 the situation grew worse when the law firm realized it had no contact or personal documentation for aluko. one mossack fonseca employee worried that this was a potential breach of the bvi\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that offshore middlemen keep such information for at least five years after a company is mothballed.  an employee sought help from aluko\xe2\x80\x99s swiss wealth manager johnnie ebo quaicoe and shared links to four unflattering online news articles. \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99m dumbfounded that mossack fonseca will print excerpts from tabloids\xe2\x80\x9d quaicoe wrote from geneva. \xe2\x80\x9cif mr aluko is truly a wanted person\xe2\x80\x9d

pull off the loan.  but concerns continued.  in september 2015 a mossack fonseca employee discovered new media reports that alleged aluko was \xe2\x80\x9con the run from the law over several controversial and fraudulent dealings in the petroleum industry.\xe2\x80\x9d employees handling the loan deal asked colleagues for \xe2\x80\x9ccomfort to proceed without being seen as facilitators to money laundering activities and corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d  by october 2015 mossack fonseca had had enough \xe2\x80\x93 almost.  it cut its final ties with three of aluko\xe2\x80\x99s four companies which had been inactive since 2014 and prepared a memo for bvi authorities outlining the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about aluko\xe2\x80\x99s activities.  before sending the memo however mossack fonseca certified the $30 million loan for aluko\xe2\x80\x99s earnshaw associates. a mossack fonseca employee justified the decision to help push through the paperwork by noting that the firm had already been working on the same loan transaction for months. quaicoe told icij he could not discuss his work with aluko. \xe2\x80\x9ci conduct business in accordance with the laws of the relevant jurisdictions pursuant to the contracts of services concluded with my clients\xe2\x80\x9d quaicoe said. ross s. delston a washington d.c. attorney and <a href="http://delston.com/">anti-money laundering expert</a> said that in general banks other financial institutions and financial intermediaries such as law firms real estate agents and trust and company service providers should be skeptical whenever they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with clients who are involved in the oil business are rumored to have close connections to politicians have been subjects of negative news stories and come from countries like nigeria that are considered high-risk geographies for corruption money laundering and other financial crimes. \xe2\x80\x9ctaken together these indicators and risk factors present not just red flags for money laundering or other financial crime but rather can be characterized as fireworks on the washington d.c. mall on the fourth of july\xe2\x80\x9d delston said. as aluko was securing his loan the heat on alison-madueke and her friends was increasing. in october 2015 a small number of alison-madueke\xe2\x80\x99s family members appeared in a london court on bribery and corruption charges and police <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-nigeria-arrests-idukkcn0rz1xn20151005">seized</a> some of the minister\xe2\x80\x99s assets including $39000 in cash. nigerian authorities have continued to arrest and arraign other alleged alison-madueke confidants. in may 2016 the lagos supreme court granted the nigerian government\xe2\x80\x99s request for an order freezing assets linked to aluko and three others. the four owed nigeria $1.76 billion dollars in unpaid dues from crude oil sales the government\xe2\x80\x99s court filings alleged and had shuffled \xe2\x80\x9clarge sums to offshore accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d the amount \xe2\x80\x9cis equal to the combined 2016 budgets of about 4 states in nigeria which monies would be utilized to cater for about 13 million\xe2\x80\x9d people the government noted. nigeria had suffered \xe2\x80\x9cimmense losses and damage\xe2\x80\x9d thanks to the failure by aluko and the others to pay what they owed. the court has frozen both of the assets used by aluko to secure his $30 million loan in late 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 the luxury yacht and the manhattan apartment in the 157 w. 57th street skyscraper known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe billionaires building.\xe2\x80\x9d  aluko and the three other defendants \xe2\x80\x9ccould use phony companies to dispose or dissipate their assets\xe2\x80\x9d out of nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s control the government argued in an effort to keep aluko and the others from selling off their assets before authorities could confiscate them. the government pointed to the sale in april 2016 of aluko\xe2\x80\x99s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hp-0514-top-sales-20160514-story.html">15000- square-foot home in beverly hills</a> as a sign \xe2\x80\x9cof desperation\xe2\x80\x9d an indication of his desire to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cthe long arms of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d in july nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s economic and financial crimes commission <a href="http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/206396-court-grants-alison-maduekes-associate-omokore-andrew-yakubu-conditional-bail.html">laid charges</a> in court against several nigerians with alleged ties to former minister alison-madueke. in a last-minute change aluko\xe2\x80\x99s name was dropped from the charge sheet after government prosecutors admitted they had been unable to serve him with documents. contrary to his wealth manager\xe2\x80\x99s claims it seems aluko remains difficult to find.</div></div>
