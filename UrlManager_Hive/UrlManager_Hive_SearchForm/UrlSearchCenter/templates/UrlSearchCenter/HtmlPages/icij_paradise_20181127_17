<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div>u.s. commerce secretary wilbur ross has sold his stake in a shipping firm with russian business connections but questions remain over whether the public and senators voting on his confirmation were given enough information prior to approval of his appointment to the cabinet. the news of the divestment from a commerce department spokesperson comes just weeks after the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and its media partners revealed details of ross\xe2\x80\x99s investments as part of the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> investigation. the revelation of ross\xe2\x80\x99 financial stake in a shipping firm that did business with close associates of russian president vladimir putin caused an <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/senators-call-for-investigation-as-ross-confirms-plan-to-sell-stake-in-russia-linked-company/">uproar among congressional democrats</a> and government transparency advocates who alleged ross had not presented the full picture of his ties to the politically connected firm navigator holdings prior to assuming his role within the trump administration. his ongoing interest in navigator presented a <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/questions-circle-wilbur-ross-ethics-gao-investigation-requested/">bevy of concerns</a> for critics scrutinizing ross\xe2\x80\x99s ability to act impartially in his government post. shortly after the report ross said he would \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/senators-call-for-investigation-as-ross-confirms-plan-to-sell-stake-in-russia-linked-company/">probably not</a>\xe2\x80\x9d keep his stake in navigator. in confirming his divestment from navigator and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/wilbur-ross-russia.html">diamond s shipping</a> \xe2\x80\x94 a firm also named in icij\xe2\x80\x99s initial reporting \xe2\x80\x94 a spokesperson for ross said the sale had been in the works for months. \xe2\x80\x9csecretary ross was not required by his ethics agreement to divest of either navigator holdings or diamond s shipping but has now completed the process he began months ago of divesting from both\xe2\x80\x9d commerce department spokesman james rockas told icij. as commerce secretary ross is in a position to shape consequential changes to global trade policy under the administration of president donald trump. the associations revealed in the paradise papers raised concerns that conflicts of interest might arise in policy matters that could affect navigator holdings. ross\xe2\x80\x99 ties to the firm also raised geopolitical questions. a major customer of navigator which is registered in the marshall islands tax haven is the russian energy firm sibur. two of sibur\xe2\x80\x99s key owners are kirill shamalov who is married to putin\xe2\x80\x99s youngest daughter and gennady timchenko a sanctioned oligarch whose activities in the energy sector the treasury department has said were \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly linked to putin.\xe2\x80\x9d even with ross\xe2\x80\x99s divestment from navigator questions still remain about his relationship with the shipping firm and about whether he gave the full picture of his international business ties before he assumed his current position. on friday the non-profit advocacy group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington (crew) filed a complaint alleging that ross\xe2\x80\x99 public disclosure of his stake in navigator holdings and other entities included \xe2\x80\x9capparent omissions and other irregularities\xe2\x80\x9d and fell short of what is required of nominees for cabinet positions. the complaint urged the commerce department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general to <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/21195628/ross-complaint-final.pdf">investigate whether ross</a> has properly reported all of his assets on his public disclosure and whether he has fully divested himself from holdings that may pose a conflict of interest. \xe2\x80\x9cassets held by government officials should not be affecting policy\xe2\x80\x9d jordan libowitz communications director for crew told icij. \xe2\x80\x9cin the case of ross he reported his holdings in navigator in a convoluted manner that made it virtually indecipherable and raises questions about whether he was doing that to try to hide the value of the holding.\xe2\x80\x9d the complaint alleges that ross appears to have violated conflict of interest rules by participating in a meeting with policy matters at stake that \xe2\x80\x9ccould enhance the value of his natural gas exploration holdings and his shipping interests in navigator holdings ltd\xe2\x80\x9d according to a <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-files-complaint-wilbur-ross/">crew press release</a>. during confirmation hearings earlier this year ross was questioned about his business ties to russia and any potential conflicts of interest yet ross\xe2\x80\x99s stake in navigator was only scrutinized after he took over as head of the commerce department. now that ross has divested from navigator new questions have arisen about ross\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff wendy teramoto who was previously employed by his private equity company wl ross &  co and was a member of navigator&#8217;s board of directors. on friday propublica reported this week that even as ross announced his divestiture from navigator <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/u-s-commerce-official-still-holds-stake-in-company-linked-to-putin-associates">teramoto had retained her</a> stake in the shipping firm \xe2\x80\x93 said to have been worth $118000 as of this past march. a commerce department spokesman told icij that prior to his divestment ross had been recused from \xe2\x80\x9cmatters having a direct and predictable effect on transoceanic shipping companies in which he had an interest including navigator holdings and diamond s shipping.&#8221; \xe2\x80\x9cms. teramoto continues to be recused from such matters\xe2\x80\x9d he said. department spokesman rockas has repeatedly declined requests to elaborate on what these matters involved.</div></div>
