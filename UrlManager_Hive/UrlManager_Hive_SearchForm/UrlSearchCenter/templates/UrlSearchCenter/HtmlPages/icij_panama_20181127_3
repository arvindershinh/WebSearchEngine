<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div>switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s federal government appears poised to crack down on money laundering in the wake of banking scandals and investigations linked to fifa chiefs and vladimir putin\xe2\x80\x99s favorite cellist among others. after the international consortium of investigative journalists 2016 <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">panama papers</a> investigation the inter-governmental financial action task force (fatf) called on the swiss known for bank secrecy to do more to thwart financial crime. on june 1 the federal government <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-70973.html">proposed three key changes to the anti-money laundering act including</a> stricter fiduciary obligations for those involved in creating managing or maintaining companies and trusts; disclosure of beneficial ownership; and establishment of a commercial register. under the proposed changes to be weighed for four months before being deliberated upon by parliament lawyers and others would be required to do due diligence to ascertain whether clients represent a risk for bribery or other wrongdoing something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t previously been required. \xe2\x80\x9cthe main point is that the government has now sided with fatf and journalists in saying this loophole has to be closed\xe2\x80\x9d said icij member oliver zihlman who writes for sonntagszeitung and le matin dimanche. icij and its media partners including zihlman exposed records listing sergei roldugin a classical cellist and long-time friend of russian president vladimir putin as the owner of offshore companies that have obtained payments from other companies worth tens of millions of dollars. it also found <a

oliver zihlmann (@oliver_zihlmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/oliver_zihlmann/status/1002927957000810496 ref_src=twsrc%5etfw">june 2 2018</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> icij and its media partners found that fifa\xe2\x80\x99s ethics head juan pedro damiani and his law firm had done work for offshore companies linked to eugenio figueredo a former fifa vice president who has been<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/17/fifa-corruption-suspect-eugenio-figueredo-extradition"> charged by u.s. authorities</a> with wire fraud and money laundering as well as to hugo and mariano jinkis a father-son team of businessmen accused of offering bribes to gain broadcast rights to fifa events in latin america. zihlman had testified before the european parliament that \xe2\x80\x9c90 percent of swiss lawyers\xe2\x80\x9d used the loophole that they were not required to do due diligence when incorporating companies with the now-closed panamanian law mossack fonseca whose files provided basis for the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">panama papers</a> investigation. the changes proposed by the swiss government also include requiring those involved in setting up companies to verify who actually owns them and to regularly check that client information is up to date. still another proposal is to require associations especially those \xe2\x80\x9cmainly involved in collecting or distributing assets abroad\xe2\x80\x9d to be listed in the commercial registry. in another development resulting from an icij investigation swiss prosecutors have raided four offices linked to the swiss-angolan businessman at the heart of <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/">paradise papers</a> revelations about the secretive financial management of angola\xe2\x80\x99s multi-billion-dollar sovereign wealth fund. <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/standardpolizei-durchsucht-bueros-von-bastos/story/10107803">federal prosecutors searched two offices</a> in late may while swiss tax officials separately visited two more including the family office of jean-claude bastos according to icij reporting partner <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/standardpolizei-durchsucht-bueros-von-bastos/story/10107803">tager anzeiger</a>. bastos who is well-connected to angola\xe2\x80\x99s former leaders founded swiss management company quantum global which received a lucrative management contract with angola\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign wealth fund. launched in 2012 the $5 billion fund paid <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/tax-haven-mauritius-africa/">$63.2 million in management fees</a> to his company in 2015. icij confirmed the raids through switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s office of the attorney general. switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s attorney-general told icij that it had \xe2\x80\x9copened criminal proceedings in april 2018 in response to reports of money laundering\xe2\x80\x9d against unnamed \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d connected to the national bank of angola and the angolan sovereign wealth fund. bastos and quantum global declined to comment to icij on the recent developments. both have previously denied wrongdoing and said that all payments were accounted for and in line with industry standards. bastos is a friend of the former head of angola\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign wealth fund jos\xc3\xa9 filomeno dos santos. santos the son of former president jose eduardo dos santos was sacked by angola\xe2\x80\x99s new president in january and is facing fraud charges relating to a $500 million transaction from the central bank. in april authorities in <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/angolan-tycoons-frozen-funds-highlight-kpmgs-role-in-offshore-secrecy/">mauritius froze 91 bank accounts</a> linked to bastos and quantum global. in an affidavit seen by icij mauritius\xe2\x80\x99s financial investigation unit requested the supreme court freeze the accounts due to \xe2\x80\x9ca serious risk of dissipation or unlawful transfer of moneys\xe2\x80\x9d belonging to the angolan people. there were reasonable grounds to believe that \xe2\x80\x9cthe acts and doings of mr jean-claude bastos \xe2\x80\xa6[are] tantamount to offences of corruption embezzlement and money laundering\xe2\x80\x9d the affidavit stated. bastos and quantum global are appealing the decision.</div></div>
