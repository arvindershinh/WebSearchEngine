<div><div><h2>Leaked Records Reveal Offshore\xe2\x80\x99s Role In Forest Destruction</h2></div><div>how lawyers and big banks help one of asia\xe2\x80\x99s largest paper companies expand despite poor environmental record and social conflicts. on the island of padang in the heart of indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s industrial logging country a group of teenagers pointed to the charred remains of sago palm trees \xe2\x80\x93 the remnants of the fires that have scorched the archipelago nation\xe2\x80\x99s lush forests for two decades. \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of anger\xe2\x80\x9d said alvin 15 who grew up in the village of bagan melibur. \xe2\x80\x9cthe effects of forest burning and deforestation are enormous\xe2\x80\x9d for both humans and animals he said. in 2015 the fires were so intense across the island chain that a bitter haze blanketed much of indonesia and drifted as far as thailand. airline flights were grounded. children wore protective masks to school. studies linked smog levels to at least 19 deaths and respiratory problems in as many as half a million people. indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s meteorology agency called the unbreathable murk \xe2\x80\x9ca crime against humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d the fires that produced the smog were a result of a prolonged dry season and slash-and-burn practices used to clear indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s lush peatland forests to make way for palm oil and pulpwood plantations. in the fires\xe2\x80\x99 wake environmental groups lashed out at the industrial players involved in clearing indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s forests including asia pacific resources international holdings ltd. also known as april one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest pulp and paper producers. a leak of offshore records now reveals that april like some other natural resources companies owed its ability to thrive and log huge sections of indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s tropical forests in part to a global network of elite bankers lawyers and accountants that helped it navigate corporate and tax challenges. the documents come from the offshore law firm appleby and corporate services provider estera two businesses that operated together under the appleby name until estera became independent in 2016. \xc2\xa0they show how the bermuda-based law firm appleby and brand-name banks such as credit suisse and the netherlands\xe2\x80\x99 abn amro have continued to help april structure its operations despite questions about the company\xe2\x80\x99s environmental record. internal records from appleby underline concerns of scholars advocacy groups and government officials that the offshore financial system contributes to the expansion of companies involved in leveling forests and other practices that contribute to global climate change. compounding the problem is the fact that indonesia home to the world\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest expanse of tropical forests has the highest rate of deforestation. the leaked documents now known as the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> were obtained by german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and 94 other media partners. an icij analysis of the documents found that april is one of a dozen asia-based forest products companies that have used the services of appleby which calls itself \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world&#8217;s largest providers of offshore legal services.\xe2\x80\x9d april has shuffled billions of dollars through a web of offshore companies stretching from the cook islands in the south pacific to the british virgin islands in the caribbean icij\xe2\x80\x99s review found. \xe2\x80\x9capril does not comment publicly on the details of its financing arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d a company spokesperson wrote in an email. april is a member of the royal golden eagle group one of asia\xe2\x80\x99s largest resource conglomerates. based in singapore rge employs more than 60000 people around the world producing paper palm oil and other products. the conglomerate is closely held and financial information about it is scarce. rge says that it provides \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic advice and comprehensive business process outsourcing\xe2\x80\x9d to april and other companies in the group and that each is \xe2\x80\x9cindependently run owns its assets and manages its finances autonomously.\xe2\x80\x9d no one doubts who controls all of it: indonesian billionaire sukanto tanoto who rose from modest circumstances to become one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most-powerful and best-connected figures. tanoto took over the family business of supplying spare parts to the oil and construction industries in 1967 according to the company\xe2\x80\x99s website and he soon won contracts from a state-owned oil and gas company. he founded rge in 1973 and then moved into the forestry business as a plywood manufacturer. the late indonesian president suharto the dictator who took power in 1967 spurred development by encouraging massive exploitation of the country\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources. he declared that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s forests \xe2\x80\x93 covering roughly three-quarters of all indonesian land \xe2\x80\x93 were state-owned brushing aside indigenous communities\xe2\x80\x99 claims to ownership. forest concessions were split among family members business partners and loyalists. by the end of the suharto era which lasted into the 1990s about 100 million acres of indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s tropical forest \xe2\x80\x93 an area the size of germany and the netherlands combined \xe2\x80\x93 had been stripped of trees by clear-cutting. tanoto opened his first pulp and paper mill with a ceremony attended by suharto and his cabinet. over the years his companies benefited from generous government subsidies provided to the forestry sector including royalties paid to the government that have been kept artificially low since the 1990s according to indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s corruption eradication commission and forestry researchers. tanoto moved into palm oil energy and a fiber used to make rayon and cellophane as the country rode the mid-1990s economic boom to become an \xe2\x80\x9casian tiger.\xe2\x80\x9d around the same time rge began moving its financial dealings to tax havens according to records reviewed by icij setting up corporate entities in zero- or low-tax jurisdictions and moving capital offshore. in september 1994 the first pieces of what would become the april group emerged with the formation of two companies in bermuda a key outpost in the offshore financial system. those firms retained appleby for administration and legal services within a year one of those bermuda entities <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164931-april-history-search.html">also known as april</a> was listed on the new york stock exchange. \xc2\xa0according to secret documents used in icij\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/offshore">offshore leaks</a>\xe2\x80\x9d investigation a singapore-based offshore services provider called portcullis trustnet helped rge set up a company in the british virgin islands and two firms in the cook islands. one of the cook islands companies was <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164941-trustnet-pectech-norscan.html">pec-tech ltd. an engineering firm</a> that became an active player in tanoto\xe2\x80\x99s pulp and paper operation. for some of the corporations created through portcullis tanoto signed contracts that authorized a third-party company to execute transactions on his behalf. tanoto an ethnic chinese citizen of indonesia signed the authorizations with his chinese name tan kang hoo. the 1997 asian financial crisis sent the indonesian economy into a tailspin and forced suharto from power. the economic shock forced the delisting of april staggering under $1.3 billion in debt from the new york stock exchange in 2001. the government of president megawati sukarnoputri stepped in to rescue the country\xe2\x80\x99s resource industry. the indonesian bank restructuring agency and national and international creditors restructured april\xe2\x80\x99s and its competitors\xe2\x80\x99 debt. \xc2\xa0according to reports by indonesian forestry experts april agreed to expand its pulp operations on the major indonesian island of sumatra in exchange for the restructuring. <img

src="//assets.documentcloud.org/embed/loader/enhance.js"></script> april also expanded to china brazil and elsewhere according to the company website. appleby documents show that <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164940-final-aig-tax-diagram.html">april has or had subsidiaries</a> in dubai the seychelles and other tax havens. these companies are not listed on april\xe2\x80\x99s public website. rge in the meantime moved its headquarters to singapore a low-tax financial center where it remains. the conglomerate\xe2\x80\x99s growing complexity came back to bite it in 2007 when indonesian tax authorities began investigating rge\xe2\x80\x99s giant palm oil affiliate known as asian agri. \xc2\xa0the government charged that between 2002 and 2005 asian agri managers devised a sophisticated tax-avoidance scheme involving 14 subsidiaries. authorities claimed that asian agri used shell corporations in the british virgin islands macao and hong kong to manipulate the price of transferred goods and artificially reduce the profits of the indonesian companies while increasing those of the low-tax offshore subsidiaries. \xc2\xa0in 2012 indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s supreme court sentenced asian agri\xe2\x80\x99s indonesian tax manager to two years in prison and ordered the palm oil company to pay more than $440 million in taxes and penalties. as rge\xe2\x80\x99s palm oil unit battled tax problems april the conglomerate\xe2\x80\x99s forest products company was mired in controversy as its expansion continued. in 2008 a government official in central sumatra was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison for taking $100000 in bribes in exchange for issuing forest plantation licenses to companies illegally logging in protected forests. seven of those companies were april wood suppliers according to several news reports. neither april nor any of its subsidiaries was charged but environmentalists said the company bears responsibility because its subsidiary purchased wood from companies operating illegally. \xc2\xa0eyes on the forest an environmental coalition claimed that april was responsible for the destruction of about 350000 acres of forestland in sumatra and that the company \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly pulped natural forest wood from concessions whose licenses were issued through corrupt practices.\xe2\x80\x9d april disputed the allegation. \xe2\x80\x9cwe undertake land conversion responsibly\xe2\x80\x9d april wrote in response to the eyes on the forest report. \xe2\x80\x9caccusations that april or those the company sources wood fibre from are operating illegally or that concessions awarded have been the subject of corrupt practices are untrue.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2016 indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s supreme court fined one of april\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0suppliers $1.2 billion after finding that the supplier had engaged in illegal logging and destroyed more than 18000 acres of forest. in 2009 a year after the bribery case in central sumatra an april subsidiary won a license to operate on padang island a much smaller island just east of sumatra. residents of bagan melibur in the southern part of the island later said they became aware of april\xe2\x80\x99s logging activities when farmers who live in the forest noticed the heavy machinery. loggers began clear-cutting the forest and planting acacia trees for paper production and excavators dug canals through the peat to transport logs to the mill and drain the wetland. villagers organized marches hunger strikes and other protests. some stitched their lips shut to protest the government\xe2\x80\x99s support of the company. one protester budimaridi (some indonesians go by a single name) said villagers use the forest to cultivate rubber trees oil palms and sago palm trees used to produce starch for biscuits and crackers. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are one family one village\xe2\x80\x9d and have \xe2\x80\x9cone problem\xe2\x80\x9d said budimaridi. \xe2\x80\x9cthey continued exploiting\xe2\x80\x9d the forest and \xe2\x80\x9cwe continued fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2013 the central government removed about 17000 acres of land claimed by the islanders including those living in bagan melibur from april\xe2\x80\x99s concession. yet according to local environmental organizations the company has continued \xc2\xa0operations there with the government\xe2\x80\x99s silent approval. \xc2\xa0april declined to comment on these allegations. \xe2\x80\x9csometimes we feel like we are not indonesian citizens anymore\xe2\x80\x9d said budimaridi who works for a local energy company. \xe2\x80\x9cour government is not strong enough to control the company.\xe2\x80\x9d even as complaints mounted the big-bank loans flowed often funneled through complex corporate webs to companies operating in indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s forests. in december 2010 for instance a group of banks led by credit suisse using appleby as counsel arranged to lend more than $180 million to the april group <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164936-2010-flow-chart.html">according to a flow chart in appleby\xe2\x80\x99s internal files</a>. \xc2\xa0the money was destined for pec-tech the cook islands engineering company. but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go directly there according to the chart. instead the borrower was a british virgin islands holding company gold crest capital which in turn would lend the sum to another british virgin islands company which would send the loan to a singapore holding company which was \xe2\x80\x9cto act as a treasury and finance centre for the april group\xe2\x80\x9d according to appleby emails. the singapore holding company heliosity consulting would lend money to april\xe2\x80\x99s indonesian pulp-supplying unit which would then pay pec-tech for a new pulp production line. the circuitous arrangement was part of a tax-driven structure designed to decrease the group\xe2\x80\x99s overall tax burden a lawyer for the banks wrote in an email to appleby. appleby did not set up this structure but provided legal services to banks lending to some of april\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries. the effects of this arrangement on taxes are not known. but the leaked files show that in 2013 an april subsidiary in the british virgin islands obtained a similar loan that was described as tax-free. an april spokeswoman said the company \xe2\x80\x9cmeets all tax obligations in the jurisdictions where it operates\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomplies with all relevant domestic and international laws and regulations in its financial dealings as part of an overall commitment to good corporate governance and to sustainable business practices.\xe2\x80\x9d experts interviewed by icij said firms can lower the cost of borrowing by moving loans through shell companies in the british virgin islands and other tax havens to financial centers such as singapore. routing the money that way can reduce or avoid withholding taxes on interest payments to lenders. the loan proceeds can then be distributed to an operating company in a high-tax country such as indonesia. this kind of arrangement is legal and indeed common. the appleby files reveal that between 2006 and 2013 april alone moved as much as $3 billion to subsidiaries through its entities in the british virgin islands and other secrecy jurisdictions. experts told icij that such arrangements often shift taxable profits away from jurisdictions that bear the social costs of resource exploitation to others that simply charge lower taxes. they also said that the use of shell companies in loan transactions enables banks to claim only limited involvement with natural resources companies that flout environmental laws. when loans are provided to offshore subsidiaries identifying responsible parties and holding them to account becomes much harder they said. numerous reports by human rights groups and development agencies have documented how land-grabbing and forced displacement of indigenous peoples are often consequences of natural resources companies\xe2\x80\x99 business practices. big foreign conglomerates they say are profiting at the expense of struggling communities whose livelihoods depend on the stewardship of the forest and the land. to protect the interests of developing countries and prevent the abuse of tax treaties to aggressively minimize corporate taxes the group of 20 world economic powers and the organization for economic cooperation and development recently endorsed a series of measures to reform international tax rules. forested areas of indonesia are vitally important not only to local populations \xe2\x80\x9cbut also to the country\xe2\x80\x99s overall economy and future as well as globally in terms of climate change\xe2\x80\x9d said stephanie fried executive director of the ulu foundation a u.s.-based environmental group. when companies use money saved by tax avoidance to invest in deforestation and other destructive activities \xe2\x80\x9cthe environmental damage and the social devastation are much broader\xe2\x80\x9d said fried who is also an expert in the indonesian forestry sector. since the mid-2000s major banks have been adopting voluntary standards to assess the environmental risks associated with lending to natural resource companies progress made under pressure from environmentalists and the world bank group. april has continued to get hefty loans even as complaints about its environmental record have mounted. \xc2\xa0in 2011 for instance one of april\xe2\x80\x99s holding companies in the british virgin islands \xc2\xa0negotiated a $600 million loan from abn amro spain\xe2\x80\x99s banco santander and others. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files show that april sought to weaken an environmental clause in loan documents. a draft version would have committed the company to \xe2\x80\x9ctake all reasonable steps in anticipation of known or expected future changes to or obligations under environmental law or any environmental licences.&#8221; in a footnote in the draft an agent for the lenders wrote that april asked that the environmental clause be deleted because it would be \xe2\x80\x9cburdensome for them to monitor and anticipate future changes to environmental law.\xe2\x80\x9d the company\xe2\x80\x99s effort was successful. april declined to comment on these efforts. an abn amro spokeswoman said the bank \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not take part in any transactions or activities that are in conflict with nature conservation\xe2\x80\x9d and does not \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate tax avoidance.\xe2\x80\x9d she declined to comment on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s business with april. two months after the loan closed in june 2011 corporate customers such as fuji xerox australia and officeworks announced that they would stop doing business with april citing environmentalists\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about deforestation and claims that the company\xe2\x80\x99s suppliers were engaged in illegal logging. in 2011 april lost a key endorsement when the forest stewardship council an environmental standards watchdog based in bonn germany withdrew certificates of approval from two of april\xe2\x80\x99s sumatran pulp and paper producers. \xc2\xa0in 2013 the council cut ties to april altogether after greenpeace and other environmental groups denounced what they described as the company\xe2\x80\x99s role in large-scale deforestation. in 2015 april did obtain certification from another body one that some environmentalists dismissed as weaker and more responsive to industry interests. in its response to the forest stewardship council\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 decision <a href="http://www.aprilasia.com/images/pdf_files/20121224-april-response-to-eof-report-of-20-dec-2012-issued.pdf">april said</a>: \xe2\x80\x9cwhile we understand there are those who are philosophically opposed to the establishment or even the existence of forestry industries in indonesia our firm view is that forestry industries are an integral element in progressing the indonesian government\xe2\x80\x99s plan for achieving the country\xe2\x80\x99s national development and environmental objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d in april 2015 credit suisse\xe2\x80\x99s chief risk officer met with greenpeace and other environmental organizations and told them that the bank would \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d its lending to april according to minutes of the meeting published on the banktrack website. about the same time santander and abn amro announced that they would provide no new loans to april. by early june 2015 april announced that it had stopped logging naturally grown forests the previous month \xe2\x80\x93 four years ahead of schedule. the company said it shifted to obtaining all of its wood from pulpwood plantations. the move encouraged greenpeace to join the company\xe2\x80\x99s stakeholder advisory committee. abn amro reversed its stand on financing citing environmental groups\xe2\x80\x99 endorsement of april\xe2\x80\x99s revised practices said banktrack\xe2\x80\x99s karen vermeer recounting an explanation the dutch bank gave in 2016. for its part credit suisse never stopped lending to april. without commenting on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s decision a spokesperson said credit suisse encourages its clients to \xe2\x80\x9caddress any sustainability or social concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d in september 2015 as wildfire-generated haze covered the region april\xe2\x80\x99s singapore holding company was negotiating another giant loan \xe2\x80\x93 for $1.1 billion \xe2\x80\x93 from a <a href="http://forestsandfinance.org/">consortium including</a> credit suisse and abn amro. appleby provided legal services to the banks to facilitate the loan according to the leaked documents. at one point emails indicate the smog \xe2\x80\x93 which environmentalists blamed on april and other forestry companies \xe2\x80\x93 got so thick that flights were canceled and april\xe2\x80\x99s indonesian executives couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave sumatra to attend talks in jakarta. they were forced to grant power of attorney to their representatives in jakarta to act on their behalf. the loan closed in late october 2015. the next year a government agency found that april\xe2\x80\x99s operation on padang island had violated a moratorium on peatland clearing imposed in the aftermath of the fires and sickening haze. peat drainage canals dry out the land and make it more prone to fire. as a result the agency halted the company\xe2\x80\x99s operations on the island and greenpeace and the world wildlife fund withdrew from april\xe2\x80\x99s stakeholder advisory committee. april issued an apology and renewed its commitment to restore and conserve forest areas. in october 2017 the indonesian environment ministry rejected the company\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa0long-term work plan because it allegedly did not comply with the nation\xe2\x80\x99s rules on peatland protection. \xe2\x80\x9ci invite [the company] to obey the rules of this country\xe2\x80\x9d the minister siti nurbaya said in a statement. since april stopped logging the forest claimed by began melibur villagers weedy vegetation some of it five feet high has taken over an expanse where meranti trees and other trees once stood tall. what residents say is an abandoned company control tower looms near a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wooden hut and his pineapple crop. on a day in early may 2017 suhairi a 31-year-old farmer walked in rubber boots across a patch of land he said had once belonged to him. \xc2\xa0he said he grew and harvested oil palm fruits there until the land was taken as part of april\xe2\x80\x99s concession. excavation tracks mar the peat. a dead python floats on the still muddy water of a canal nearby. suhairi dug up a handful of soil to show the fossilizing bits of organic matter that make up peat. he remembered hunting mouse-deer and bees for honey in the forest as a child. once he thought he\xe2\x80\x99d work the land he inherited from his father and pass it on to his son now 5 one day. now that\xe2\x80\x99s in doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cif we have our farm we have hopes that we can still earn a living\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cif they take our land how can we imagine a future \xe2\x80\x9d</div></div>
