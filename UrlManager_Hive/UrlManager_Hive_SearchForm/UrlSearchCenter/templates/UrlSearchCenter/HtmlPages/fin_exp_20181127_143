<div><div><h2>Equity infusion may not aid Vodafone-Idea expansion</h2></div><div>the huge debt of around rs 112500 crore of vodafone idea will leave little for capex and market-capturing strategies even though the management is infusing some rs 25000 crore of equity. analysts at jpmorgan wrote on thursday that vodafone idea \u201cdoes not appear to be in a position to fund even basic capex given the burdensome leverage\u201d. even if the entire rs 25000 crore is used to service debt the newly merged entity will be left with a debt of rs 92000 crore taking into account interest cost by the end of the current financial year they added. analysts at jefferies said: \u201cthe fundraising plans if successful will be a positive as it will provide comfort on the ability to complete its capex plans and fund the business over the next 18 month \u201c. increased capex by vodafone idea as expected by jefferies and goldman sachs could see competitive intensity sustaining over the next one year longer than is expected after jio started a price war. on the contrary jpmorgan expects the competition intensity to depend on rjio\u2019s pricing stance which they believe \u201cdoes not need to turn constructive given rjio\u2019s strong sustained subscriber addition and top-line growth\u201d. vodafone idea\u2019s combined capex for h1fy19 was rs 5700 crore compared with airtel\u2019s rs 15900 crore and more than rs 32000 crore by jio. \u201cwhile vodafone idea has recently increased capex its overall spending remains materially below that of airtel and jio continuing to put it at a disadvantage\u201d ubs said in a report on thursday. goldman sachs observed that should the company decide to divert the fresh equity towards capex which has been relatively small and consequently hurt revenue growth the interest outgo will remain high. \u201c.this trend (of slower revenue growth) could continue for the next 2-3 quarters until network integration for the company is complete\u201d analysts at the firm noted. the interest cost in q2fy19 was rs 2166 crore. while the estimated interest outgo is rs 7566 crore for 2018-19 it is expected to go up to rs 11480 crore in fy20. vodafone idea\u2019s net-debt-to-ebitda ratio will remain at 15-16 times range \u2014which jp morgan termed \u201cuncomfortably high\u201d \u2014 compared with the current 29 times. peer bharti airtel\u2019s net-debt-to-ebitda at the end of the september quarter was 4.65 times. at the end of september while vodafone idea (422.3 million) was the market leader in terms of total subscriber base ahead of bharti (332.8 million) and jio (252.3 million) it lost 13.1 million subscribers during the quarter compared with 11.8 million lost by airtel and 37 million gained by jio. even the average revenue per user of vodafone idea at `88 for the september quarter was lower compared with peers airtel (rs 100) and jio (rs 132). the shares of vodafone idea on thursday tumbled 11.10 % or rs 4.60 to close at rs 36.85 apiece on a day benchmark sensex gained 0.34%. most equity research firms expect the stock to remain under pressure and under-perform the market. the management will contribute 73% of the fresh capital with `11000 crore from vodafone and rs 7250 crore from aditya birla. the remaining rs 6750 crore will be raised from the market either through rights issue qip or preferential issuance among others. vodafone idea \u2014 which was created on august 31 2018 when idea cellular and vodafone india merged \u2014 announced its first quarterly result on wednesday registering a loss of rs 4973 crore. the results take into account the one-month impact of vodafone\u2019s financials.</div></div>
