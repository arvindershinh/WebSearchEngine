terrorism nuclear weapons proliferators and gunrunners. one morning in mid-2014 before the summer sun had reached its peak two elderly men in aleppo syria sat on plastic chairs chatting quietly and drinking black coffee.  from his perch outside his food stall sabri wahid asfur and his friend abu yassin watched their neighbors go about their day. suddenly bombs hit the ground scattering bricks and debris. seconds later they exploded sending thousands of pieces of shrapnel \xe2\x80\x94 nails rebar \xe2\x80\x94 in all directions. the crudely made barrel bombs had been designed for maximum human damage. as the smoke lifted asfur reached for abu yassin. \xe2\x80\x9ci looked at my friend when i recovered my vision and saw his body in shreds\xe2\x80\x9d asfur remembers. \xe2\x80\x9che was exhaling his last breath.\xe2\x80\x9d   the attack was one of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/syria">hundreds</a> of aerial bombings that syrian president bashar al-assad\xe2\x80\x99s regime has carried out during the country\xe2\x80\x99s six-year civil war killing thousands of its own people. the deadly air campaign would not have been possible u.s. authorities have charged without a network of companies that dodged international embargoes by supplying the oil and gas that kept the military aircraft in sky. three of the companies that the u.s. alleges helped supply the fuel were customers of a global law firm mossack fonseca &  co. which helped the companies incorporate and maintain offshore branches in seychelles a tax haven in the indian ocean. <div class="image article__image image--medium image--floatright" id="3643"><div class="image__headline">    <div class="image__caption" class="image__title--small">syrian president bachar

one of these closely-linked companies after the three of them were blacklisted by the american government for supporting syria\xe2\x80\x99s war machine \xe2\x80\x93 joining dozens of other mossack fonseca customers sanctioned by the u.s. treasury department\xe2\x80\x99s office of foreign assets control. mossack fonseca which is based in panama but has offices around the world has worked with at least 33 individuals or companies that have landed on the treasury department\xe2\x80\x99s ofac list according to an analysis of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s internal files by the international consortium of investigative journalists the german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and other media partners.  in some cases individuals and companies had ceased to work with mossack fonseca before being sanctioned. in other cases the entities were active customers when the sanctions were put in place. the reporting partners reviewed more than 11 million documents \xe2\x80\x94 emails client accounts and financial records \xe2\x80\x94 that show the inner workings of mossack fonseca from 1977 to december 2015. for years the records show mossack fonseca has earned money creating shell companies that have been used by suspected financiers of terrorists and war criminals in the middle east; drug kings and queens from mexico guatemala and eastern europe; nuclear weapons proliferators in iran and north korea and arms dealers in southern africa. \xe2\x80\x9cit sounds almost like a corporate death wish taking on that many horrible people\xe2\x80\x9d said jason sharman a political scientist at australia\xe2\x80\x99s griffith university and co-author of a groundbreaking study of anonymous companies. \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d think that even if they were cynical they\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant dealing with u.s. sanctioned entities and taking on the united states.\xe2\x80\x9d mossack fonseca denies wrongdoing. a spokesman told icij that the firm relies on intermediaries such as banks and other law firms to review the backgrounds of the customers that they refer to mossack fonseca. these middlemen are supposed to notify the firm \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as they have knowledge of a client of theirs having been either convicted or listed by a sanctioning body\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. \xe2\x80\x9clikewise we have our own procedures in place to identify such individuals to the extent it is reasonably possible.\xe2\x80\x9d the time it takes to resign varies by jurisdiction the spokesman said and some authorities require the agent to remain in place to prevent interference with an investigation. the spokesman added that mossack fonseca has \xe2\x80\x9cnever knowingly allowed the use of our companies by individuals having any relationship with north korea zimbabwe syria and other countries\xe2\x80\x9d that have been listed as sanctioned. if it did discover it had unknowingly represented a company that was being used for unlawful purposes he said the law firm would take \xe2\x80\x9cany measures that are reasonably available to us\xe2\x80\x9d to deal with the issue. ofac the u.s. treasury department\xe2\x80\x99s blacklist enforcement unit <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl9718.aspx">announced a series of sanctions in 2014</a> barring u.s. citizens from dealing with individuals and companies suspected of supporting the syrian regime. one of the companies was pangates international corporation limited a petroleum products specialist headquartered in the united arab emirates that had been a mossack fonseca customer for more than a decade. ofac put pangates on its blacklist in july 2014 charging that pangates had supplied the syrian government with 1000 metric tons of \xe2\x80\x9cavgas\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 aviation fuel necessary to operate military aircraft. \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly any armed syrian air force aircraft will be using avgas\xe2\x80\x9d said jane\xe2\x80\x99s defence weekly europe editor nick de larrinaga. pangates is part of the abdulkarim group a sizeable syrian company with offices in damascus. ofac also sanctioned two other mossack fonseca clients with alleged ties to the abdulkarim group or its directors \xe2\x80\x94 maxima middle east trading co. and morgan additives manufacturing co. in addition it sanctioned two syrian citizens linked to the companies. ofac identified ahmad barqawi as general manager of maxima middle east trading co. and wael abdulkarim as pangates\xe2\x80\x99 managing director. it said wael abdulkarim had \xe2\x80\x9cworked to arrange numerous shipments of base oils and aviation gasoline to syria.\xe2\x80\x9d in june 2014 pangates maxima and the abdulkarim group worked with a russian oil and gas firm to obtain oil destined for syrian government-controlled refineries <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/ofac-enforcement/pages/20150803.aspx">according to ofac</a>. a representative of morgan additives told icij that the basis of its blacklisting by ofac was \xe2\x80\x9cin error.\xe2\x80\x9d  barqawi resigned as the company\xe2\x80\x99s manager before the ofac listing and wael abdulkarim resigned when the sanctions were announced the representative said. morgan additives is not currently owned or controlled by wael abdulkarim the representative added. none of the other companies or individuals sanctioned in connection with the syrian air war responded to repeated requests for comments via email registered mail and telephone. <div class="image

sizes="(max-width: 1433px) 100vw 1433px"></div>in a previous comment to media pangates acknowledged delivering oil to syria but claimed not to know about its ultimate destination or purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are selling to non-syrian firms who are not on the eu and us sanctions list\xe2\x80\x9d the company <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/19/syria-sanctions-idusl5n0d42bs20130419">told reuters</a>. &#8220;we do not know exactly who is finally using the fuel but according to our information the product is used for civil humanitarian purposes.&#8221; the secret files show pangates\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with mossack fonseca began in 1999 when the law firm incorporated pangates in niue the pacific island nation where mossack fonseca once had exclusive rights to incorporate offshore companies. when authorities in niue shut down the island\xe2\x80\x99s offshore registration industry in the wake of complaints about money laundering pangates moved to samoa and in 2012 to seychelles. at one point the company valued itself at $7.5 million. nine months after the u.s. first sanctioned pangates mossack fonseca was still handling the company\xe2\x80\x99s paperwork <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2782962-160404-sanctions-03.html">certifying</a> that it was a seychelles company in good standing. later still mossack fonseca helped pangates close its seychelles business and sent it a bill for $1100 to cover its fee for that service. it asked pangates to pay online or through mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s bank account in new york. it was not until august 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 more than a year after sanctions against pangates had been announced \xe2\x80\x94 that mossack fonseca acknowledged the blacklisting and scrambled to find ownership details utility bills or any other identifying information from the dubai administrators of pangates and maxima middle east. mossack fonseca finally reported that the companies were on international sanctions lists to seychelles regulators in august 2015. the files show that mossack fonseca also worked with rami makhlouf a cousin of syria\xe2\x80\x99s dictator assad. as early as 2008 u.s. treasury officials had <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp834.aspx">flagged</a> makhlouf as a \xe2\x80\x9cregime insider\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cimproperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of syrian regime officials.\xe2\x80\x9d treasury froze makhlouf\xe2\x80\x99s u.s. assets and banned u.s. companies or people working with him. later that year in a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/syria-airbus-idinls5298920080828">widely reported announcement</a> the u.s. treasury department blacklisted some of his companies. although he had long been a customer of mossack fonseca the firm\xe2\x80\x99s emails at the time record no mention of the sanctions. that changed in 2010 when british virgin island authorities demanded information on drex technologies s.a. a company owned by makhlouf that mossack fonseca had incorporated ten years earlier. mossack fonseca employees looked for \xe2\x80\x94 and quickly found \xe2\x80\x94 information that had circulated widely for years including details of makhlouf\xe2\x80\x99s political ties and alleged smuggling. at this point the files reveal mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s head of compliance wanted to drop makhlouf immediately. but one of mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s partners resisted hoping the firm would not lose the business. that partner chris zollinger wrote colleagues that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are allegations (rumors) but not any facts or pending investigations or indictments.\xe2\x80\x9d he noted a colleague\xe2\x80\x99s earlier notes from a conversation between mossack fonseca and hsbc the uk-headquartered bank that served as makhlouf\xe2\x80\x99s financial manager in which the bank assured the law firm that hsbc\xe2\x80\x99s geneva and london offices \xe2\x80\x9cknow about mr. makhlouf and that they are comfortable with him.\xe2\x80\x9d if hsbc didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an issue with him zollinger said \xe2\x80\x9cthen i think we can also accept him.\xe2\x80\x9d however he ultimately agreed with dropping the firm after further urging from his colleagues and mounting official investigations into makhlouf\xe2\x80\x99s business empire. zollinger recently told s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung: \xe2\x80\x9cin retrospect my comment in the e-mail was wrong which i regret.\xe2\x80\x9d he added that as registered agent mossack fonseca had \xe2\x80\x9cno influence on the transactions or the business of the company\xe2\x80\x9d linked to makhlouf. makhlouf did not respond to requests for comment.  mossack fonseca took a more aggressive attitude toward petropars limited a company controlled by the iranian government that was sanctioned by the u.s. treasury in june 2010. the relationship between petropars and mossack fonseca began in 1998 nearly 20 years after the iranian revolution when mossack fonseca incorporated petropars in the british virgin islands. petropars was known to watchers of iranian politics as an intermediary between foreign companies and iran\xe2\x80\x99s oil ministry. with offices in dubai and london it was also a player in the development of iran\xe2\x80\x99s multibillion-dollar south pars natural gas field. three years before mossack fonseca began work for petropars president bill clinton citing iranian support for terrorism and its quest for weapons of mass destruction <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/documents/iran.pdf">banned</a> u.s. involvement with iranian oil. not bound by the u.s. prohibition mossack fonseca helped petropars to issue shares in a tehran-based oil investment company in 1998. petropars\xe2\x80\x99 links to the iranian government were highlighted as early as 2001 when iranian authorities investigated and then charged board members of the company in connection with \xe2\x80\x9cirregularities\xe2\x80\x9d in lucrative gas contracts. by 2002 the news had made headlines in <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/1103559">the economist</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/oil-dispute-grips-iran-corruption-or-politics.html">the new york times</a>. the 2001 corruption allegations \xe2\x80\x9cput petropars on the map\xe2\x80\x9d says georgetown university political scientist paasha mahdavi. \xe2\x80\x9ceven before any of the allegations emerged it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have required too much digging to know this is a company whose majority at the very least is controlled by government officials.\xe2\x80\x9d petropars remained a customer of mossack fonseca until 2010 when j\xc3\xbcrgen mossack one of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s founders learned that his company\xe2\x80\x99s british virgin islands post office box had been listed as petropars\xe2\x80\x99 address in ofac\xe2\x80\x99s blacklist entry for the company. after an internet search a company employee in the bvi office marcia dacosta recommended that the firm cut petropars loose. \xe2\x80\x9cit is a decision that may be 12 years too late\xe2\x80\x9d added another employee daphne durand \xe2\x80\x9cbut one that must be taken in light of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d the firm\xe2\x80\x99s founders \xe2\x80\x94 mossack and ram\xc3\xb3n fonseca \xe2\x80\x94 agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d mossack <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2782957-160404-sanctions-02.html">emailed</a>. \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody knows that there are united nations sanctions against iran and we certainly want no business with regimes and individuals from such places! not because of ofac but out of principle. anybody having had to do anything with this company at absolutely all levels should have realized immediately that the names associated with it were iranian names. a red flag should have been raised immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d the firm resigned as registered agent of petropars in october 2010. mossack blamed the london office which had processed petropars\xe2\x80\x99 paperwork and should have conducted what the financial industry calls \xe2\x80\x9cdue diligence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 checking on customers\xe2\x80\x99 identity and making sure they\xe2\x80\x99re not involved in questionable activities. \xe2\x80\x9cit would appear mossack fonseca uk are not doing their due diligence thoroughly (or maybe none at all)\xe2\x80\x9d mossack said. early this year as a result of the deal that lifted economic sanctions against iran in exchange for that country&#39;s disabling key parts of its nuclear program the united states removed petropars and other iranian-controlled oil companies from the ofac blacklist. the files show that despite repeatedly admitting internally that its existing checks and balances had failed mossack fonseca did not introduce a comprehensive policy to comply with ofac sanctions rules until july 2015. \xe2\x80\x9cglobal companies that don\xe2\x80\x99t have the appropriate compliance systems in place allow actors like terrorist organizations drug cartels and human traffickers to continue operating and to engage in illicit and damaging behavior\xe2\x80\x9d said eric lorber senior associate at the financial integrity network who advises financial institutions on complying with ofac. \xe2\x80\x9cbetween 2005 and 2007 is when any global company especially one with interests in the u.s. should have really been paying attention. that\xe2\x80\x99s really when ofac put the world on notice.\xe2\x80\x9d &#8220;it&#39;s like the accountant of al capone &#8211; a firm that clearly has chosen to service rogue regimes\xe2\x80\x9d said emanuele ottolenghi senior fellow with the foundation for the defense of democracies in washington d.c. commenting not on mossack fonseca which was not named at the time of the conversation but on a description of its practices. an ofac spokeswoman declined to comment for this story saying it is ofac\xe2\x80\x99s policy to not talk about current or future investigations. in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 years after mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s first brushes with sanctioned companies \xe2\x80\x94 the firm audited its london office. the final report concluded the u.k. office had \xe2\x80\x9cno procedure in place\xe2\x80\x9d for handling high-risk politicians family and associates and \xe2\x80\x9csearches using search engines are not being conducted\xe2\x80\x9d to screen potential clients. audits of mossack fonseca offices in singapore thailand brazil and dubai faulted them on poor record keeping background checks and procedures for handling politicians family and friends.  each office scored poorly across every measure of performance receiving ratings of \xe2\x80\x9cunsatisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9croom for improvement\xe2\x80\x9d which indicated either \xe2\x80\x9cserious failings\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csome weaknesses.\xe2\x80\x9d the dubai office which represented pangates and other companies sanctioned for aiding syria\xe2\x80\x99s air war <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2782956-160404-sanctions-01.html">was rated \xe2\x80\x9cunsatisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d</a> on every measure. basic internet searches to check out customers\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds were not conducted the audit said. in 2009 for example the firm admitted in internal communications that it had incomplete records on a company later sanctioned for \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging millions of dollars of transactions in support of the north korean regime\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities.\xe2\x80\x9d also in 2009 mossack fonseca ended its relationship with zimbabwean businessman john bredenkamp. bredenkamp on the firm\xe2\x80\x99s books since 1997 had been <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/burundi/plundering-dr-congo-natural-resources-final-report-panel-experts-s20021146">described</a> in 2002 by a united nations expert panel as \xe2\x80\x9cexperienced in setting up clandestine companies and sanctions-busting operations.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2008 months before mossack fonseca cut ties bredenkamp was sanctioned by ofac for allegedly being a \xe2\x80\x9ccrony\xe2\x80\x9d of zimbabwe dictator robert mugabe and a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-known mugabe insider.\xe2\x80\x9d bredenkamp did not respond to requests for comment but he has consistently denied allegations concerning him and his companies and has denied having supported president mugabe.  in 2012 bredenkamp successfully overturned european union sanctions against him and his companies. one company tremalt limited purchased equipment for armies in the democratic republic of congo the united nations alleged.  it took seven years before a mossack fonseca employee reported internally that an internet search implicated a separate company the law firm said was owned by bredenkamp \xe2\x80\x9cin a series of allegations concerning arms deals.\xe2\x80\x9d the files also show that in april 2011 mossack fonseca learned that ofac had accused financiers of hezbollah \xe2\x80\x94 a middle east terrorist group that has used child soldiers and fired rockets into populated towns \xe2\x80\x94 of using a mossack fonseca shell company. the company was reportedly part of a \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork linked to terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s compliance chief sandra de cornejo wrote. it had taken mossack fonseca months to notice ofac\xe2\x80\x99s listing. it cut ties with the company ovlas trading s.a. in may 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cwhat i do not understand is why the initial due diligence did not reveal these issues to begin with!\xe2\x80\x9d j\xc3\xbcrgen mossack berated colleagues in an email. \xe2\x80\x9csurely the due diligence process is flawed somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers representing ovlas trading said the bvi company was formed for tax-saving reasons as part of a food import and export business. the company has been \xe2\x80\x9cmostly dormant\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyers said. \xe2\x80\x9cat no time was ovlas bvi involved in any money laundering terrorist financing narcotics or other illicit activity\xe2\x80\x9d the company\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers said. a major international accounting firm conducted a forensic investigation into ovlas\xe2\x80\x99 business the lawyers said and found \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of any activity described by the u.s. treasury department. the company\xe2\x80\x99s owner has \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly stated that he has not been and is not a supporter of hezbollah\xe2\x80\x9c and efforts to have the sanctions lifted are ongoing. mossack fonseca did have guidelines for sanctions before 2015 including a risk matrix that included pariah states and countries under embargo as well as a \xe2\x80\x9cmossfon black list\xe2\x80\x9d of countries that required special attention. but the files reveal mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s management did not follow up on recommendations that the firm introduce more stringent policies on ofac screenings. in 2010 in response to the petropars debacle marcia dacosta a compliance specialist had suggested \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive compliance policy is needed in relation to our approach to sanctioned countries and individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d in a 2015 memo citing \xe2\x80\x9crecent changes in our organization\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory matters\xe2\x80\x9d mossack fonseca announced it would drop 35 potentially risky companies \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d they included businesses purportedly dealing in oil in belarus and russia mobile phones juice tomato paste and cheese in the middle east investment companies in uganda and guinea shipping in west africa and real estate in lebanon and zimbabwe. mossack fonseca would not act as the agent for any companies with activities in countries on the ofac list such as sudan and south sudan and would be more cautious in other countries subject to limited sanctions the memo said. several offshore experts said that sanctions enforcers in the u.s. and elsewhere haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid enough attention to offshore middlemen like mossack fonseca despite their key role in creating the companies that enable wrongdoing. this is partly because of limited resources available to pursue cases according to daniel reeves former lead investigator for the internal revenue service\xe2\x80\x99s offshore compliance initiatives. but things can change reeves said. \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a time when people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go after banks they wanted to go after their
