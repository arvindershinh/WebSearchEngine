<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>new delhi: the government may soon come out with a one-time settlement for minor and non-serious company law offences  which would remove about 60% of the ongoing cases in the national company law tribunal (nclt) and special courts in one stroke and free them up to deal with insolvency matters.cases that maybe withdrawn under the scheme are likely to fall under 16 categories of minor and nonserious offences that attract both fines and penal provisions. they would include failure or delay in filing resolutions and financial statements  contraventions related to director identification numbers and managerial remuneration and delay in filing of notices for alteration of share capital.a 14-member committee set up by the government for decriminalisation of offences under the companies act is working on re-engineering various provisions to reduce the number of such cases and also liberalising the act.about 22 000 cases in various benches of the nclt and special courts in the country could be withdrawn under this provision. the move would significantly de-clog the existing company matters-related judicial infrastructure  allowing speedier resolution of insolvency cases  apart from providing relief to thousands of companies that have committed procedural lapses and violations.in future  the government proposes to deal with these 16 categories of violations through an in-house online platform  which would minimise the human interface for minor and non-serious violations.“going forward  any such violation cases won’t go to nclt but would be handled through an in-house adjudication e-platform ” a government official said. “transgressions that are purely procedural or technical in nature should be viewed in a broader perspective. hence  this amnesty scheme is being proposed along with an in-house adjudication mechanism. it will be one of the largest company law settlement schemes.”filing-related violations that are procedural in nature and violations that are related to governance — barring those suggestive of fraud or adverse to public interest — are likely to be dealt with in-house.“it will lessen the burden on courts and enhance transparent compliance by companies. however  there will be no weakening or dilution of the penal provisions pertaining to major violations such as frauds or anything that has adverse impact on public interest ” the official said. “by bringing provisions related to non-critical non-compliance under an in-house adjudication mechanism  the entire redressal process would be much smoother and efficient. also  companies would get a window to regularise the compliances ” said anshul jain  a partner at luthra & luthra law offices.as per the proposal  the in-house adjudication mechanism will function in a transparent manner within the mca-21system  the e-governance initiative of the ministry of corporate affairs. the issue of notices  levy of penalties and ensuring compliance would take place through the e-platform.“notices would be sent through the e-platform and replies would also be submitted on the same platform. the move would also significantly reduce the time for disposal of such cases ” the official said.“if the entire process is completely online  then the most critical aspect would be the parameters basis which thresholds of penalties for such non-compliance would be decided by the adjudicating authority. it would be interesting to see if this exercise is aimed at only smoothening the process or also addressing uncertainties as to the time and quantum of penalties in disposing of such matters ” said jain of luthra & luthra.</div></div>
