<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>neeraj bharadwaj  md of carlyle asia partners  has to steady the ship in india  after a round of senior-level exits. he shares his view on the exodus and the private equity scenario in india in an interview with suman layak & baiju kalesh. edited excerpts'carlyle recently saw a round of senior-level exits recently. we have also seen a lot of similar churn in the pe landscape in india. how do you see these moves carlyle’s india portfolio is doing very well. we have raised a $6.5 billion asia fund. our pace of investing in india has been increasing over six-seven years. in the last fund  over 20% was invested in india. we aspire to do that number or something larger for india. so it’s a very key market. in that context  when we talk about departures  some people would prefer to do something slightly more entrepreneurial as the market opportunity grows. it has happened in other markets also. you will see that evolution in this market as well.you have merged the two funds carlyle had in india. why we used to have two platforms  the growth platform and the buyout platform. the distinction was deal size. as a part of the onecarlyle strategy  we have now integrated these under one platform because that makes it more seamless from an execution standpoint.how do you see the india potential if india delivers on gross domestic product growth — if your gdp is growing at 7-8%  you have companies growing at 15-16% —returns will come. india is not a cheap market. it’s always been an expensive to a very expensive market. so you have to get convinced about the growth.hasn’t the insolvency process given a great opportunity for buyouts i agree. it gives good assets at reasonable valuations. it allows one to back independent management. and then  like i said  in india if you look at private equity  it has been driven by equity returns. there is no other form of value accretion. multiple expansions are always a challenge in india because you are already trading at a relatively superior level. so having another leeway where you can get leverage return is a huge advantage.</div></div>
