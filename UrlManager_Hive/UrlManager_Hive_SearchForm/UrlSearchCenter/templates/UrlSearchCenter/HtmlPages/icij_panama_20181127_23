if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about legal fees in the seven figure range they could be looking at recovering a considerable amount of cash.\xe2\x80\x9d the nevada case is one of a number of legal battles and investigations focused on mossack fonseca and its clients following the panama papers revelations. in july the wall street journal reported that u.s. federal prosecutors had <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-prosecutors-probe-panama-papers-law-firms-employees-1469737691">launched a criminal investigation</a> into the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s employees over allegations they helped clients launder money or evade taxes. in response to the wall street journal\xe2\x80\x99s questions about the investigation mossack fonseca referred to a statement on their website which says the firm has \xe2\x80\x9cnever been accused or charged in connection with criminal wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d  the new york banking regulator also levied a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-22/bank-tied-to-panama-papers-firm-to-be-investigated-in-taiwan">$180 million penalty</a> against the taiwanese mega international commercial bank after an investigation by the state uncovered suspicious transactions flowing between the bank\xe2\x80\x99s new york and panama branches and found links between the bank and mossack fonseca. mega international commercial bank also now faces an official investigation in taiwan.  <em>contributor to this story: hamish boland-rudder</em></div></div>
