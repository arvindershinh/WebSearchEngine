<div><div><h2>The &#8216;Paradise Papers&#8217; and the Long Twilight Struggle Against Offshore Secrecy</h2></div><div>a new mass data leak this time from an elite law firm with elite clients shows how deeply offshoring is embedded in the global financial system. the \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a>&#8221; the latest in a series of global journalistic expos\xc3\xa9s of the offshore financial industry has triggered tax-related investigations by governments around the world \xe2\x80\x94 from the netherlands to vietnam to new zealand. based on yet another mass data leak the paradise papers sparked new or expanded criminal investigations in switzerland and <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-offshore-connections-latin-american-presidents-ministers-business-leaders-revealed/">argentina</a> accelerated <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/bermuda-luxembourg-new-eu-blacklist-omits-major-tax-havens/">sweeping reforms by the european union</a> triggered a wave of audits in <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-lifts-veil-role-offshore-finance-asia/">india and south korea</a> and sparked political uproar in turkey and angola. <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/apples-secret-offshore-island-hop-revealed-by-paradise-papers-leak-icij/">apple inc</a>. the tech giant and global symbol of corporate tax avoidance with a staggering $252 billion offshore will face renewed scrutiny from margrethe vestager the european union\xe2\x80\x99s competition commissioner. some reformers believe a long-awaited global crackdown on a rogue system is finally at hand. \xe2\x80\x9cwith this the secrecy of tax havens and transactions done through them <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/paradise-papers-arun-jaitley-panama-papers-probe-cbdt-jayant-sinha-black-money-4925933/">have been smashed</a>\xe2\x80\x9d india\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister arun jaitley told the indian express. he said publication of the paradise papers \xe2\x80\x9cshows that nothing remains a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d but no one should be fooled. the offshore industry is a sprawling behemoth so secretive its very size can only be guessed and yet understood to be so large as to distort the global economy. a conservative estimate finds that at least $8.7 trillion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html">11.5 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealth</a> is hidden offshore diverting billions from strapped national governments to the accounts of powerful corporations and individuals. they in turn use their power to further rig the global tax game at the expense of everyone else. about 63 percent of u.s. multinationals\xe2\x80\x99 foreign profits are held offshore the main reason that effective u.s. corporate tax rates were already relatively low before the new tax law lowered them further. about 10 percent of europe\xe2\x80\x99s total wealth is now offshore along with almost one-third of africa\xe2\x80\x99s and fully half of russia\xe2\x80\x99s. the paradise papers project was made possible by a leak of more than <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">13 million documents</a> \xe2\x80\x94 the bulk of them from an elite offshore law firm <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/appleby-offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-of-compliance-failures-icij/">appleby</a> \xe2\x80\x94 to s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung. the documents were shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and more than <a href="https://www.icij.org/paradise-papers-media-partners/">90 global media partners</a>. what in fact the paradise papers confirmed in sobering detail is the extent to which the offshore industry has outgrown its origins on the margins of the financial system. it is much more than a string of shadowy operations like the mossack fonseca law firm the focal point of the blockbuster 2016 <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org">panama papers expos\xc3\xa9</a>. epithets like \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crogue\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to appleby which has been named \xe2\x80\x9coffshore law firm of the year\xe2\x80\x9d more than once and is a member of the \xe2\x80\x9coffshore magic circle\xe2\x80\x9d an informal collection of leading offshore law firms. its clients include princesses prime ministers and hollywood stars as well as corporate giants: apple <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/swoosh-owner-nike-stays-ahead-of-the-regulator-icij/">nike</a> facebook and <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/">glencore</a> the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest commodities trader. the paradise papers documents reveal that appleby\xe2\x80\x99s collaborators have included the law firms baker mckenzie and akin gump strauss hauer &  feld; the accounting giants kpmg ernst &  young and pricewaterhousecoopers; and the global money-center banks citigroup bank of america hsbc credit suisse and wells fargo. luke harding a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding">guardian reporter</a> and a partner on both the panama papers and paradise papers observed in 2016 that the offshore world was once thought to be a <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/10/27/panama-the-hidden-trillions/">shadowy</a> but minor part of our economic system. now we know: \xe2\x80\x9cit <em>is</em> the economic system\xe2\x80\x9d he said. as big it was even the panama papers at 2.6 terabytes the largest data leak ever handed to journalists uncovering of thousands of shell companies offered a peek at perhaps 5 percent of that slice of that particular offshore market which itself is only part of sprawling and multifaceted shadow financial system the economist and offshoring authority <a href="http://gabriel-zucman.eu">gabriel zucman</a> told alan rusbridger in an interview for <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/11/10/panama-papers-big-stash-of-the-big-rich/">the new york review of books</a>. \xe2\x80\x9ceven if you have gigabytes of data\xe2\x80\x9d zucman said \xe2\x80\x9csince they only involve one particular firm in one particular country that\xe2\x80\x99s involved in one particular form of tax haven activity there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to make meaningful inference from that as to what\xe2\x80\x99s the scale of the global problem the magnitude of tax avoidance and tax evasion the costs for governments.\xe2\x80\x9d the paradise papers \xe2\x80\x94 the sixth in a <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/916/more-documents-more-journalists-and-bigger-revelations/">series of investigations</a> in which the icij and its partners used mass data to examine offshore-related matters \xe2\x80\x94 advances public knowledge to yet another level. but as zucman noted switzerland alone reported $2.4 trillion in assets managed by swiss banks for foreigners about 60 percent of that in shell companies. u.s. individuals by zucman\xe2\x80\x99s estimate \xe2\x80\x9care evading $30 billion a year [in taxes] through unreported offshore assets\xe2\x80\x9d while u.s. multinational companies are avoiding $120 billion \xe2\x80\x9cby artificially shifting profits to bermuda and similar places.\xe2\x80\x9d and then zucman said \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the whole banking aspect to it \xe2\x80\x94 you know bankers in switzerland and luxembourg and everywhere who are creating shell companies or trusts or foundations and so on; or who are actively helping some of their clients to hide assets; who are investing their funds on their behalf and so on and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d if one defining characteristic of democracy is that everyone plays by the same rules then democracy is in trouble all over the world. \xe2\x80\x94 attac france (@attac_fr) <a href="https://twitter.com/attac_fr/status/942058573969977350 ref_src=twsrc%5etfw">december 16 2017</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> is there no hope  on dec. 16 more than two dozen french protesters carrying magnifying glasses and wearing sherlock-holmes-style deerstalker hats landed on the isle of jersey and headed for the only place on the island authorized to sell iphones. \xe2\x80\x9capple apple apple pay your taxes!\xe2\x80\x9d they chanted. the anti-globalization movement <a href="https://france.attac.org/actus-et-medias/salle-de-presse/article/apres-les-paradise-papers-attac-cherche-apple-sur-l-ile-de-jersey">attac</a> had arrived to conduct a satirical \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d into whether the tech behemoth actually did corporate business in the well-known tax haven \xe2\x80\x94 a fair question since billions of dollars of the iphone-maker\xe2\x80\x99s profits are booked there. the protesters found that apple had no visible presence on the island beyond the solitary apple store. two weeks before other attac protesters <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/04/apple_store_paris_protest/">stormed an apple store</a> in central paris handcuffing themselves to balustrades and forming conga lines as they chanted demands that the company pay $15 billion in taxes. if global efforts to reign in the offshore system have gained momentum rising public awareness has been a key factor. in the six weeks after public disclosure of the paradise papers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/ q=paradise%20papers">facebook</a> users had viewed posts about the project a staggering 182 million times. some of the widely read and distributed posters biggest influencers were politicians \xe2\x80\x93 u.s. sen. bernie sanders the vermont independent for example. the reach spanned countries and continents with some of the most active online interaction coming in france india and mexico. for a few hours on nov. 6 a day after publication of the first paradise papers news stories google searches for \xe2\x80\x9cparadise papers\xe2\x80\x9d outnumbered even those for \xe2\x80\x9cdonald trump.\xe2\x80\x9d social media users called for boycotts of major companies and institutions named in the paradise papers including apple and nike another corporate giant that has shifted billions of dollars in profits between tax havens to avoid taxes in europe. on twitter people liked or retweeted content related to the paradise papers more than 1.5 million times. top posts came from sanders u.k. opposition leader jeremy corbyn actor mark ruffalo and other celebrities. \xe2\x80\x9cleak day is my favorite day. #paradisepapers\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="https://twitter.com/snowden/status/927291228307238912">edward snowden tweeted</a> on nov. 5. the post was retweeted more than 6000 times and \xe2\x80\x9cliked\xe2\x80\x9d more than 11500. but the vast majority of social media responses came from average people moved enough to speak up. \xe2\x80\x9cof course tax havens are \xe2\x80\x98morally wrong\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 it&#8217;s called cheating\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="https://www.facebook.com/icij.org/posts/10155122979076512">holly boruck posted on facebook</a> from california in a typical response. another person asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhen are they going to change the law so these tax evaders either serve time or pay their fair share like most americans who may

ref_src=twsrc%5etfw">november 17 2017</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> students marched in the streets in the u.k. and held meetings in the u.s. to protest their universities\xe2\x80\x99 offshore investments which as the paradise papers revealed included the use of \xe2\x80\x9cblocker\xe2\x80\x9d corporations to avoid taxes on endowments. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is kind of ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d kari barclay a 23-year-old stanford university phd candidate and student council member remembered some members saying during a council meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cpeople didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see stanford\xe2\x80\x99s name among corporations and wealth folks in the papers\xe2\x80\x9d barclay said. the council called for the university to divest its holdings in offshore companies. in quebec protesters waved flags and banners in front of parliament to protest tax evasion and in glasgow scotland an artist commandeered a roundabout to set up an exhibit complete with inflatable palm trees play money and a washing machine. a sign above the installation read \xe2\x80\x9cthe offshore paradise bank.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />the offshore industry once invisible to all but a few specialists has become a topic of public discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cthe paradise papers show the magnitude of the exploitation\xe2\x80\x9d the <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/editorial-the-paradise-papers-show-exploitation-12348282.php">san francisco chronicle</a> declared in an editorial. \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a maddening reality for the rest of us who pay our fair share of the cost of public services.\xe2\x80\x9d south africa\xe2\x80\x99s <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/editorials/2017-11-09-editorial-an-issue-that-taxes-us-all/">business day</a> \xe2\x80\x94 remarking that tens of billions of dollars were likely sitting undeclared outside the country \xe2\x80\x94 said in an editorial: \xe2\x80\x9cthe clear lesson for policy makers &#8230; is that we need astute fair and competent tax authorities to tackle the complexities of global tax shopping effectively and ensure the public purse receives what is due to it.\xe2\x80\x9d and <a href="https://global.handelsblatt.com/opinion/disguising-deals-erodes-the-economy-848739">handelsblatt global</a> made the point that offshore schemes hurt the very idea that capital should be allowed to flow freely. \xe2\x80\x9cthese tax evaders not only undermine the economy and the system which makes their profits possible but the very principle of globalization\xe2\x80\x9d wrote jan hildebrand a handelsblatt editor. \xe2\x80\x9cand the particularly cruel irony is that many of the us president\xe2\x80\x99s closest associates who campaigned against globalization to secure his election victory were themselves named in the paradise papers.\xe2\x80\x9d the offshore system\xe2\x80\x99s historical roots are deeper than commonly supposed. journalist and author <a href="https://twitter.com/nickshaxson lang=en">nicholas shaxson</a> traces them to the postwar collapse of the british empire and the transformation of former island colonies \xe2\x80\x94 bermuda the british virgin islands the cayman islands \xe2\x80\x94 into british overseas territories which like the u.k. itself embraced the role of financial intermediary. \xe2\x80\x9cby the end of 1959 about $200 million was on deposit abroad\xe2\x80\x9d rusbridger wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cby 1961 the total had hit $3 billion\xe2\x80\x9d. jurisdictions around the world began to compete for offshore money and a financial race to the bottom began. financial deregulation of the reagan and thatcher years supercharged the process and the \xe2\x80\x9coffshore\xe2\x80\x9d industry soon expanded in some u.s. states ireland and other developed jurisdictions. a small cadre of support professionals became a global industry folded into dedicated practice areas of megabanks and major law and accounting firms. the financial crisis of 2008 for all the misery it caused helped to expose the offshore industry. facing plummeting tax revenues governments were forced to turn to an obvious source: tax evaders and avoiders. in 2010 the u.s. enacted the landmark 2010 foreign account tax compliance act forcing foreign banks to hand over data on their u.s. clients or face a 30 percent tax on u.s. bank transactions. the g-20 group of nations and the organization for economic co-operation and development began working on transparency and information-sharing measures that in 2014 evolved into the the global common reporting standard or crs. this automated information exchange while wonky could have far-reaching effects on individual countries\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to locate and tax assets held in other jurisdictions. so far more than 100 countries have committed to <a href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/international-tax/aeoi/what-is-the-common-reporting-standard.aspx">implementing the system</a> although critics point to loopholes that give countries broad discretion in deciding which countries can receive their data. switzerland has been singled out as being particularly unforthcoming. international reform efforts have been accompanied by a series of global journalistic expos\xc3\xa9s based on unprecedented mass data leaks from well-placed professional-services firms in the offshore sector. each has caused a public outcry that has kept the heat on international reform efforts experts say. in april 2013 icij and 40 media partners published an expos\xc3\xa9 based on leaked documents from firms in singapore and the british virgin islands that specialized in creating discrete wealth-management tools. \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/offshore/">secrecy for sale</a>\xe2\x80\x9d was the first of icij\xe2\x80\x99s investigations of the hidden financial dealings of politicians con artists and the mega-rich around the world. in 2014 \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/luxembourg-leaks/">luxembourg leaks</a>\xe2\x80\x9d based on 28000 pages of leaked records revealed confidential deals between the government of luxembourg and some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest corporations agreements that granted in some cases effective tax rates below 1 percent. in 2015 \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/swiss-leaks/">swiss leaks</a>\xe2\x80\x9d exposed how hsbc\xe2\x80\x99s private bank in switzerland aided tax evasion and hid millions of dollars in corrupt proceeds for clients. then came the <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org">panama papers</a>. based on more than 11.5 million files leaked from mossack fonseca the investigation exposed the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s history of providing secretive companies and tax-evasion vehicles for scores of politicians criminals billionaires and celebrities. the project led to arrests prosecutions and resignations including the resignations of the prime ministers of <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/20161201-global-impact.html">iceland</a> and <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/20171020-pakistan-pm-sharif-indicted.html">pakistan</a>. sixteen countries have collected a total of <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/12/500-million-recovered-tax-authorities-worldwide-following-panama-papers/">$554.5 million in penalties and unpaid taxes</a> through panama papers-related investigations according to a survey of icij media partners. mexico\xe2\x80\x99s tax authority for instance recovered $52 million oscar molina chie head of the large taxpayers&#8217; unit told icij\xe2\x80\x99s mexican media partner proceso. the canada revenue agency said it audited 136 taxpayers and recovered nearly $15 million because of \xe2\x80\x9csecrecy for sale\xe2\x80\x9d and audited 300 taxpayers recovering $39 million because of \xe2\x80\x9cswiss leaks.\xe2\x80\x9d the agency reported that 123 canadians are undergoing audits triggered by panama papers revelations and that several related criminal investigations are in progress. the paradise papers will probably bear fruit in four to seven years the agency predicted. beyond the statistics the panama papers propelled offshoring and tax evasion onto the public agenda globally &#8212; and then the paradise papers gave it another boost. \xe2\x80\x9ci think it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that there is public outrage on such a scale\xe2\x80\x9d zucman told rusbridger in the new york review interview. \xe2\x80\x9cat the global level people felt very strongly that something is wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d this month during a session that ended at 2 a.m. the european parliament voted to require all european countries to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/eu-to-force-companies-to-disclose-owners-with-directive-prompted-by-panama-papers">publish the names</a> of all companies\xe2\x80\x99 true owners. the anti-money-laundering measure which eu countries have 18 months to add to their domestic laws also represents a breakthrough in the global fight against secrecy and tax avoidance. the law was passed despite opposition from the u.k. ireland luxembourg and other states that act as tax havens or tolerate them. it also sets a new standard for laggards including the united states which continues to tolerate high levels of secrecy in nevada delaware and elsewhere. roberto gualtieri chairman of the parliament\xe2\x80\x99s economic and monetary affairs committee said revelations by investigative journalists made the difference between this year\xe2\x80\x99s effort and those of years\xe2\x80\x99 past. \xe2\x80\x9ci remember how tough it was\xe2\x80\x9d said gualtieri of italy. the eu also accelerated the adoption of a long-promised \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/bermuda-luxembourg-new-eu-blacklist-omits-major-tax-havens/">blacklist</a>\xe2\x80\x9d of tax havens. while the list fell short some advocates\xe2\x80\x99 expectations \xe2\x80\x93 it left off european countries and popular caribbean havens under british control \xe2\x80\x93 reformers said it was a start. since publication of the paradise papers governments opened tax investigations in vietnam lithuania indonesia ireland greece the netherlands new zealand australia nigeria and pakistan. south korea\xe2\x80\x99s national tax service said it is probing 37 citizens and companies.recently indian authorities sent the first set of summonses to 23 \xe2\x80\x9cgroups\xe2\x80\x9d named in the paradise papers. antonio gustavo gomez attorney general of tucuman province argentina said the paradise papers exposed offshore companies related to minera alumbrera a copper and gold company operated by commodity giant glencore. his office is probing alleged pollution tax evasion and money laundering according to a letter his office sent to icij. separately argentine lawmakers filed a complaint against finance minister luis caputo alleging crimes that included failing to <a href="http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/denunciaron-penalmente-a-caputo-tras-las-revelaciones-de-paradise-papers.phtml">disclose his offshore interests</a> and breaching his duties as a public official. in the netherlands the secretary of state for finance announced a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df1156dc-c497-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675">review of 4000 agreements</a> between corporations and the national tax office after two icij media partners the newspapers trouw and financieele dagblad revealed that rules had been breached in issuing a $169 million tax break for consumer-products giant procter &  gamble. but the ultimate battle over the future of the offshore system will be fought in the u.s. which remains a financial hegemon through its control over access to the us financial system &#8212; a life-or-death matter for any jurisdiction or institution with a stake in international finance. plus in nevada delaware and elsewhere it remains a tax haven itself. democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/questions-circle-wilbur-ross-ethics-gao-investigation-requested/">called for an investigation</a> into president donald trump\xe2\x80\x99s commerce secretary wilbur ross after the paradise papers revealed <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/">ross\xe2\x80\x99s ties to influential russian business interests</a>. ross held a stake through a complex chain of cayman islands firms in a shipping company that earned millions of dollars from an energy company co-owned by members of russian president vladimir putin\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle including his son-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9csecretary ross\xe2\x80\x99 financial disclosures are like a russian nesting doll with blatant conflicts of interest carefully hidden within seemingly innocuous holding companies\xe2\x80\x9d said sen. richard blumenthal a connecticut democrat and member of the committee that confirmed ross as secretary in january. a commerce department spokesman said this month that ross had <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/questions-remain-over-wilbur-ross-disclosure-as-he-confirms-divestment/">divested himself of shares</a> in the shipping company navigator holdings ltd. the department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general and the government accountability office an investigative arm of congress told icij that they are reviewing the requests for investigations. icij\xe2\x80\x99s investigation thrust apple\xe2\x80\x99s tax practices into the public eye just as apple was poised to become the biggest beneficiary of then-proposed legislation that included tax cuts for u.s. multinationals with foreign profits parked offshore. after icij published details of apple\xe2\x80\x99s tax arrangements republicans in congress increased to 15.5 percent from 10 percent the bill\xe2\x80\x99s proposed tax rate on overseas cash profits brought home to the u.s. the existing rate at the time was 35 percent and the reduction was promoted as an incentive to multinational corporations to repatriate profits. the measured was signed into law this month by trump. on one hand the company would have to pay billions of dollars more than had previously been proposed to bring home all its overseas cash. on the other the law still has a huge tax benefit for apple. and so it goes. as nobel prize-winning economist joseph stiglitz noted in a recent speech the question isn\xe2\x80\x99t about specific features of the offshore system. it\xe2\x80\x99s whether the offshore system serves any legitimate purpose at all or simply allows the rich and powerful to flout rules followed by everyone else. \xe2\x80\x9cthe reality is that they put their money there in order to engage in either tax avoidance tax evasion regulatory avoidance regulatory evasion\xe2\x80\x9d stiglitz said. \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason for the very existence of these offshore paradises.\xe2\x80\x9d  contributors to this story: <a
