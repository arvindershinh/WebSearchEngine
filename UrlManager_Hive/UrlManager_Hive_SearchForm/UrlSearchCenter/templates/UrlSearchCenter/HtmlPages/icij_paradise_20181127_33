<div><div><h2>Paradise Papers firm managed millions for a carousel of millionaires and fraudsters</h2></div><div>asiaciti one of the asia-pacific\xe2\x80\x99s biggest offshore specialists provided secretive companies for clients across the globe. it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t most 4-year-old girls\xe2\x80\x99 idea of an ideal present. in february 2008 golden-haired happy received from her mother five books written by her father james b. \xe2\x80\x9cjim\xe2\x80\x9d rogers a u.s. billionaire investor including one more than 430 pages long and another on how to invest in corn cotton and coal. \xe2\x80\x9cadventure capitalist: the ultimate investor\xe2\x80\x99s road trip\xe2\x80\x9d was one title in young happy\xe2\x80\x99s birthday bonanza. \xe2\x80\x9chot commodities: how anyone can invest profitably in the world\xe2\x80\x99s best market\xe2\x80\x9d was another. happy\xe2\x80\x99s mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t give copies of the books to the 4-year-old. what she did was transfer the ownership of the books\xe2\x80\x99 copyrights to happy and another daughter \xe2\x80\x93 still one month away from being born \xe2\x80\x93 known as \xe2\x80\x9cbaby bee.\xe2\x80\x9d she did this via two offshore trusts often hard-to-trace creations of a sort long regarded warily by tax authorities as smokescreens for hidden wealth and tax-avoidance schemes. the gift was one of dozens of transactions used to fund seven trusts established for jim rogers\xe2\x80\x99 wife and daughters and himself. some trusts were structured \xe2\x80\x9cfor tax purposes\xe2\x80\x9d rogers\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer explained in 2013 to asiaciti a singapore-based offshore services specialist. rogers did not respond to requests for comment. the trusts were declared to the internal revenue service asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s files show. in the years that followed the trusts of happy and baby bee received more than $100000 in royalties from their father\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling books. by 2015 trusts worth more than $32 million had been established for family members by the adventurous rogers who is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cindiana jones of finance\xe2\x80\x9d and holds guinness world records for globetrotting by motorcycle and by car. the leak of 556000 files from asiaciti passed largely unnoticed within the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> a trove of 13.4 million documents that reveal <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">offshore secrets</a> of politicians <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2017/668/6069/">celebrities</a> billionaires and <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/apples-secret-offshore-island-hop-revealed-by-paradise-papers-leak-icij/">companies</a> whose brands are household names. asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s emails trust application forms faxes and bank statements are vastly outnumbered by leaked documents from <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/appleby-offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-of-compliance-failures-icij/">appleby a law firm</a> and corporate services provider with offices around the globe. yet the files from asiaciti \xe2\x80\x93 a trust specialist headquartered in singapore with branches in tax havens such as the cook islands and samoa in the pacific and nevis in the caribbean \xe2\x80\x93 shine a light on the practices of offshore clients ranging from the ultra-wealthy to the unremarkable with a host of questionable clients in between. asiaciti did not respond to written questions but <a href="https://www.asiacititrust.com/2017/11/06/response-to-media-coverage/">issued a statement</a> that it complies with applicable laws and regulations at all times. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are regulated by highly competent authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and are committed to achieving the standards required\xe2\x80\x9d asiaciti said. \xe2\x80\x9cwe absolutely deny any implication of wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d founded in 1978 by graeme briggs an australian accountant asiaciti expanded throughout the 1980s and 1990s. it has described itself as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the leading offshore trust groups in the asia-pacific region.\xe2\x80\x9d asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s files reveal a significant american client base including a california dentist an alabama grocer a u.s. handgun and rifle manufacturer and a food-truck entrepreneur from los angeles. also found are chinese millionaires and clients from switzerland romania nigeria thailand and south africa in addition to an israeli \xe2\x80\x9cbranding\xe2\x80\x9d expert an egyptian gynecologist and a 26-year-old british eye serum and moisturizer salesman. asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s services range from tax accounting and \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.asiacititrust.com/services/private-clients/">wealth protection</a>\xe2\x80\x9d services for individuals to secretarial services for global corporations. a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4223976-asiaciti-brochure.html">major moneymaker is trusts</a>. <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/secret-world-offshore-mega-trusts/">offshore trusts</a> are often inscrutable legal instruments with blurred official ownership. the details are rarely a matter of public record. <a href="https://www.icij.org/tags/offshore-secrecy/">trusts</a> allow the publicity-shy to act out of sight of creditors ex-spouses or courts. asiaciti has specialized in establishing trusts in samoa and the cook islands nations of 200000 and 11000 people respectively. within 24 hours and for less than $300 a client could buy \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98state of the art\xe2\x80\x99 offshore products\xe2\x80\x9d to build and preserve wealth according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040406224408/http://www.asiacititrust.com:80/">archived version of asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s</a> website. \xe2\x80\x9cthe sad fact is that cook islands trusts are routinely used by people to cheat legitimate creditors\xe2\x80\x9d said jay adkisson an attorney and expert witness in a fraud case that involved asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s trust division. it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult and expensive for creditors attorneys or the tax office to access funds held by a client\xe2\x80\x99s trust adkisson said. \xe2\x80\x9cthey say \xe2\x80\x98nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah you can\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ci instinctively raise an eyebrow when i see a cook islands trust\xe2\x80\x9d adkisson said \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there are so few legitimate reasons for using such a trust but many bad ones.&#8221; the leaked files reveal that authorities found omissions in asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s records including client records that lacked information necessary to combat money laundering and tax evasion. for example an audit by the cook islands financial supervisory commission in 2008 found a 33 percent level of compliance with regulatory standards. \xe2\x80\x9cgrrr so annoying\xe2\x80\x9d an employee at one asiaciti office wrote about other asiaciti offices whose incomplete files on four trusts were highlighted by a government audit. asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s clients included the family of serik burkitbayev a former aide to kazakhstan president nursultan nazarbayev and head of kazakhstan\xe2\x80\x99s state-owned oil and gas company. in march 2009 a kazakh court convicted burkitbayev of embezzlement \xe2\x80\x93 the theft of $20 million \xe2\x80\x93 and other crimes. burkitbayev was sentenced to six years in prison according to kazakh news media. by september 2012 as burkitbayev languished behind bars his wife and two daughters had set up three trusts in \xe2\x80\x93 according to the phrasing of one lawyer \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ca small island nation named after an intrepid english sea captain whose surname rhymes with book.\xe2\x80\x9d the cook islands trusts listed burkitbayev as a beneficiary meaning that he could eventually receive the offshore money. asiaciti knew of burkitbayev\xe2\x80\x99s political past but proceeded with the family\xe2\x80\x99s business according to emails sent in 2013. emails from 2013 make no mention of his conviction. the trusts would be funded with $2 million from a real estate deal and $6.6 million from the 2011 sale of one daughter&#8217;s interest in a former soviet cluster bomb factory that was turned into a plant for the production of oil and gas cylinders according to an email. that plant a leaked u.s. state department cable said was taken from a u.s. company by \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically influential\xe2\x80\x9d kazakhs in late 2005. the kazakhs \xe2\x80\x9cplay dirty\xe2\x80\x9d according to the cable which reported that an assistant of burkitbayev\xe2\x80\x99s assailed the u.s. company with \xe2\x80\x9cwhat appeared to be an open threat to use political leverage.\xe2\x80\x9d under the 2011 sales agreement shared with asiaciti burkitbayev\xe2\x80\x99s 29-year-old daughter and his former personal aide \xe2\x80\x93 the same assistant cited in the u.s. cable \xe2\x80\x93 owned about 77 percent of the kazakh plant. asiaciti reviewed the documents and said it was \xe2\x80\x9ccomfortable\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding with the trusts. they were closed in 2016. the burkitbayev family did not reply to requests for comment. among asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s other u.s. trust clients were sean novis and gary denkberg marketing executives who targeted pensioners in a mail-fraud scheme according to a civil complaint filed by the u.s. justice department. novis denkberg and others told elderly victims that they had won more than $1 million and asked them to pay a fee \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally in the range of $19.99 to $24.99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to receive the prize the 2016 civil complaint alleges. victims often received nothing in return according to the complaint. over four years the marketers and others allegedly pocketed more than $30 million. novis and denkberg had one trust each with asiaciti that at one stage held more than $1 million each according to asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s files. in february 2007 novis asked the firm to help him find a bank that did not have \xe2\x80\x9ca presence in the usa.\xe2\x80\x9d both men\xe2\x80\x99s trusts were active in 2016 when asiaciti learned of the civil case. in 2016 a court imposed an injunction that prohibited novis and denkberg from mailing prize offers and sweepstakes in the united states. the justice department took no further action a spokesman told icij. denkberg told icij that his trust was not involved in the civil case and that to his knowledge it had not held more than $1 million. the trust complied with the law and was declared to tax authorities he said. novis did not reply to requests for comment. gold and juice trader sherman unkefer iii used his cook islands trust called the mango trust and set up by asiaciti to \xe2\x80\x9cconceal his accumulated wealth\xe2\x80\x9d according to a county prosecutor in arizona who brought a civil racketeering claim in 2014. during and after his eight years in prison on a previous fraud conviction unkefer concealed assets to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4224041-mango-trust.html">avoid repaying $18 million</a> to more than 1300 fraud victims the prosecutor alleged. asiaciti was listed as a co-defendant in the case and was served with the complaint in the cook islands in june 2014 emails show. the racketeering claim against unkefer has been dropped although alleged victims continue to seek compensation a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor told icij. reached by phone unkefer\xe2\x80\x99s partner said the couple had no comment. the money in the mango trust was returned to the united states in 2014 said michael fitzgibbons the court-appointed officer who is seeking compensation for unkefer\xe2\x80\x99s victims. \xe2\x80\x9cit was obvious they were trying to make his assets if any as unreachable as possible\xe2\x80\x9d fitzgibbons said.</div></div>
