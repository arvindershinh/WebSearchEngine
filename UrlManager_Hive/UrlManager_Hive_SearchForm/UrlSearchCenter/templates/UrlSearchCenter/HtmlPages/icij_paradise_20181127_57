<div><div><h2>Kremlin-owned Firms Linked to Major Investments in Twitter and Facebook</h2></div><div>the russian government quietly held a financial interest in u.s. social media. a major investor in twitter and facebook had financial ties to two russian government-owned firms known as vehicles for the kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s politically sensitive dealings newly unearthed documents show. the records show that one of the kremlin-owned firms vtb bank quietly directed $191 million into an investment fund dst global that used the money to buy a large stake in twitter in 2011. they also show that a subsidiary of the kremlin-controlled energy giant gazprom heavily funded an offshore company that partnered with dst global in a large investment in facebook. dst global\xe2\x80\x99s founder russian billionaire yuri milner and other partners in the deals reaped large gains when they sold their stakes shortly after <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/facebook-raises-16-billion-in-i-p-o/">facebook\xe2\x80\x99s initial public offering in 2012</a> and twitter\xe2\x80\x99s in 2013. there is no indication that the kremlin gained influence over twitter or facebook or received inside information about the firms as a result of investments associated with milner. but the disclosure shows that years before <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/russian-interference-in-the-2016-election-a-cacophony-not-a-conspiracy">russia meddled in last year\xe2\x80\x99s u.s. presidential election</a> the kremlin had a financial interest in american social media. these revelations come at a time when congress is investigating the u.s. tech giants\xe2\x80\x99 role in the spread of russian disinformation during donald trump\xe2\x80\x99s successful campaign for the white house. it\xe2\x80\x99s public knowledge that milner put together large investments in twitter and facebook. the russian government\xe2\x80\x99s ties to the investments were not previously known. facebook and twitter said they had properly reviewed milner\xe2\x80\x99s investments. the details of the kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s links to the deals were uncovered during a joint investigation\xc2\xa0by the international consortium of investigative journalists the new york times the bbc and other media partners. the news outlets\xe2\x80\x99 reporting effort drew on public records contained in the isle of man\xe2\x80\x99s corporate registry documents from the <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org">2016 panama papers leak</a> and a new <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">trove of confidential records</a>\xc2\xa0the <a href="http://icij.org/investigations/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> obtained by german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung. in response to questions from icij and its partners milner said the investments his firm makes including the twitter and facebook deals have always been based on business merits and have nothing to do with politics. milner acknowledged that vtb the russian bank was one of the partners that helped bankroll the twitter investment as well as dst global\xe2\x80\x99s investment in chinese e-commerce site jd.com. he said that less than 5 percent of his firm\xe2\x80\x99s investment funding came from russian government institutions. he stressed that vtb bank was a passive investor in the twitter deal arranged by his investment fund dst global. he said the russian bank like all of his limited partner investors did not gain any control over twitter or dst global\xe2\x80\x99s investment vehicles. milner said he was not aware of any possible financial links between the gazprom subsidiary and dst global until icij and its partners contacted him with questions in mid-september. he noted that the twitter and facebook deals occurred during a period of better diplomatic relations between russia and the united states. \xe2\x80\x9cit was a different time\xe2\x80\x9d milner said in an interview with the new york times. \xe2\x80\x9cit never even occurred to me back then that vtb bank was not just another investor for us.\xe2\x80\x9d gazprom is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2017/05/24/the-2017-global-2000-these-are-the-largest-companies-in-russia/#3d5860ad62af">russia\xe2\x80\x99s largest state-owned</a> corporation and vtb is russia\xe2\x80\x99s second-biggest bank. questions about their ties to u.s. social media investments are sensitive because of the firms\xe2\x80\x99 controversial histories and ties to russian president vladimir putin and other kremlin officials. the u.s. government <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/us-issues-new-sanctions-against-russia/375267/">sanctioned vtb in 2014</a> in response to russia\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of crimea. dst global had sold its stake in twitter by then. the gazprom subsidiary linked to milner\xe2\x80\x99s facebook investment \xe2\x80\x94 gazprom investholding \xe2\x80\x94 was managed for more than a decade by alisher usmanov a politically connected uzbek-russian billionaire. in addition to running the state-owned subsidiary usmanov has also been a big player as a private investor. he has built personal stakes in a various industries including partnering with milner on the facebook and twitter deals and other tech investments. the kremlin has used gazprom investholding for \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically important and strategically important deals\xe2\x80\x9d ilya zaslavskiy an adviser to the kleptocracy initiative a project of the hudson institute a conservative think tank in washington d.c. told the new york times. it is a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful political and economic instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d vtb is also known as a player in russia\xe2\x80\x99s political system. vtb\xe2\x80\x99s chairman <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f26b2d3c-63d3-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227">andrei kostin is a putin ally</a>. \xe2\x80\x9con the one hand it\xe2\x80\x99s a bank on the other it\xe2\x80\x99s an instrument of the kremlin\xe2\x80\x9d sergey aleksashenko a russian banking expert with the brookings institution who served on vtb\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors in the 1990s told icij. \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever the kremlin wants vtb is ready to do.\xe2\x80\x9d in response to questions from icij and its partners vtb confirmed that it had invested in twitter through milner\xe2\x80\x99s firm dst global. vtb said it had \xe2\x80\x9csold its stake in the company with a profit making it a successful transaction for us.\xe2\x80\x9d vtb called itself a \xe2\x80\x9csolely commercial bank\xe2\x80\x9d asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have never had any politically motivated deals.\xe2\x80\x9d milner emphasized that vtb is traded on the london stock exchange and has previously had public investment partnerships in silicon valley. in an emailed statement a spokesperson for gazprom investholding confirmed that it had provided loans to an offshore company named kanton services which records reviewed by icij show was a shareholder in investment vehicles used by dst global in the twitter and facebook deals. the spokesperson said no \xe2\x80\x9crussian officials were involved in these loans.\xe2\x80\x9d for years milner has been known as a businessman with a knack for connecting big investors with a wide range of promising tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 and he has earned billions for investors who have trusted him to make smart bets with their money. milner 55 was born in moscow and studied business at the university of pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s wharton school in the 1990s eventually returning home to launch a series of investments that would vault him to the top of russia\xe2\x80\x99s entrepreneurial elite. in 2001 he seized on the dot-com bust to become ceo of the struggling internet firm mail.ru. under milner&#8217;s leadership the company grew into russia\xe2\x80\x99s primary email provider and the country\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent tech firm. in 2005 milner formed tech firm digital sky technologies. three years later he partnered with usmanov one of russia\xe2\x80\x99s richest men. usmanov became a major shareholder in dst global the investment fund milner established in 2009. soon milner set his sights on bigger deals in america. while assessing the facebook investment in early 2009 milner befriended facebook founder mark zuckerberg. his investment in zuckerberg\xe2\x80\x99s firm later that year made him famous in a silicon valley still reeling from the financial crisis. milner has said that his strategy of refusing to accept board seats or voting rights at companies in which dst global invests allows him to put money into competitors without creating conflicts of interest. when it came to investing in facebook milner told forbes this strategy \xe2\x80\x9csent a strong message that we are not seeking any influence over facebook\xe2\x80\x99s operations.\xe2\x80\x9d between 2009 and 2011 milner managed a series of investments in facebook using both his tech firm mail.ru and his investment fund dst global to buy a growing chunk of the social networking platform. usmanov\xe2\x80\x99s investments in milner\xe2\x80\x99s ventures made him a key partner in these deals. dst global and mail.ru\xe2\x80\x99s stake in facebook reportedly grew to roughly $7 billion making milner\xe2\x80\x99s firms facebook\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest group of outside shareholders. during facebook\xe2\x80\x99s record-breaking initial public offering on may 18 2012 existing investors made dazzling returns on the social network. four days after the ipo a dst global subsidiary sold more than 27 million facebook shares yielding roughly $1 billion according to sec filings. in an interview milner confirmed that kanton services was an investor in one of the dst global vehicles that bought shares in facebook. milner said his firm subjected kanton to rigorous screening before taking it on as a partner. even if kanton received russian government money milner said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be possible to know whether that money found its way into facebook because kanton could have used other sources of funding for the investment. in response to a question from icij and its partners about kanton services\xe2\x80\x99 ties to the facebook deal gazprom investholding stated that its loans to kanton \xe2\x80\x9cwere provided for general corporate purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckanton was being backed by gazprom\xe2\x80\x9d said david zweighaft a new york-based forensic accountant who has worked for the accounting firm deloitte and as a contractor for the u.s. justice department. zweighaft reviewed key documents at icij\xe2\x80\x99s request. <iframe src="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/stories/paradise-papers e=1" width="100%" height="750" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> a spokesperson for facebook emphasized that dst global had no control over the company. \xe2\x80\x9cit is worth noting that as a passive investor dst themselves had no voting rights or board seat\xe2\x80\x9d facebook said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cthe investment was made eight years ago and dst global has since sold all their holdings in facebook \xe2\x80\x94 their stake ended five years ago when we went public.\xe2\x80\x9d kanton services is a company with several links to usmanov. the leaked records reviewed by icij indicate that all of kanton\xe2\x80\x99s shares were owned as recently as 2009 by an investment manager named leon semenenko who is known as an usmanov business associate. rollo head a spokesman for usmanov said usmanov \xe2\x80\x9chas been a highly successful investor in russian and international assets utilizing a combination of his own and borrowed funds.\xe2\x80\x9d head said none of usmanov\xe2\x80\x99s investments in facebook and jd.com used money borrowed from state institutions. as a passive investor in milner\xe2\x80\x99s deals the spokesman said usmanov had no control over dst funds or their underlying investments. in addition to its participation in milner\xe2\x80\x99s facebook deal kanton services also played a role in his investment in twitter. in july 2011 vtb invested at least $191 million in exchange for the vast majority of shares in dst investments 3 an investment vehicle based in the isle of man according to public records in the isle of man\xe2\x80\x99s corporate registry. that same month milner used dst investments 3 to finance nearly half of dst global\xe2\x80\x99s stake in twitter. kanton services was also a shareholder in dst investments 3 but appears to have contributed little money to the deal. yet records show that several months after twitter\xe2\x80\x99s ipo in late 2013 vtb transferred the bulk of its shares in dst investments 3 to kanton services. a spokesperson for dst global declined to provide specific information about arrangements kanton services may have had with vtb. in a statement a spokesperson for twitter said that dst global is \xe2\x80\x9ca well known entity in silicon valley\xe2\x80\x9d and that the social media firm had reviewed all of its investors. milner\xe2\x80\x99s investments in american firms haven\xe2\x80\x99t been limited to big silicon valley ventures. in 2015 milner was one of several high-profile investors in cadre a new york-based real estate technology firm co-founded by jared kushner donald trump\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law and an adviser to the president. the company was founded in 2014 by kushner and his brother joshua along with another entrepreneur. milner said he invested $850000 of his own money. none of the funds came from dst global he said. with major rounds of funding from outside investors kushner\xe2\x80\x99s business grew in value to a reported $800 million. the white house and kushner\xe2\x80\x99s company cadre declined comment. milner said he met jared kushner once at a conference and has made no additional investments in cadre. he said his stake in the presidential son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s company is \xe2\x80\x9cno different\xe2\x80\x9d from other investments he has made \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s about business not political connections. when he was young he said his father warned him \xe2\x80\x9cplease don\xe2\x80\x99t get involved in politics.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cand as i spent most of my life in the soviet union\xe2\x80\x9d milner said \xe2\x80\x9cit was my principle back then and still now.\xe2\x80\x9d  contributors to this story: <a href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/frederik-obermaier/">frederik obermaier</a> and <a
