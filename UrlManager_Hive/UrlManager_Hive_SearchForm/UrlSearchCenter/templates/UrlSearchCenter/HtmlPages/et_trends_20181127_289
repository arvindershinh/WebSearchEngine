<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>mumbai: harvard business school dean nitin nohria  who is a nominee of tata trusts on the board of tata sons  is stepping down from his non-executive director position at the holding company of the tata group. the india-born american academic has communicated to the tata brass his desire of not wanting an extension of his term on the company’s board  sources familiar with the matter said. nohria was appointed as a non-executive director of tata sons in september 2013 and his five-year term will come to an end next month. nohria will be the second person to step down from the board of tata sons in recent weeks after vijay singh. but unlike singh  70  who was also a nominee of the powerful trusts that own two-thirds of tata sons  the decision by nohria  56  to not continue on the holding company’s board has come as a surprise. this is because according to tata sons’ retirement policy  the retirement age for non-executive directors is 70.after tata sons ousted cyrus mistry as chairman in 2016  the corporate governance controversy erupted at the conglomerate  dragging nohria and other members into it. following the changes  the trusts will now have to nominate two representatives on the tata sons board  whose strength has been reduced to 10 members. according to tata sons’ articles of association  the trusts will have one-third representation on the board of tata sons and that crucial proposals like acquisitions and investments beyond rs 500 crore to be undertaken by listed and unlisted group companies will have to be approved by majority of the nominated directors. currently  the only trusts nominee on the board of tata sons is amit chandra  md of bain capital and brother-in-law of nohria. chandra  nohria and singh were the first external trusts nominees on tata sons.</div></div>
