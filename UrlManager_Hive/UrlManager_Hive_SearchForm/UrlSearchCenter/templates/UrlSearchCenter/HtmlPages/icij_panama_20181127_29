<div><div><h2>Out of Africa, Into Tax Havens</h2></div><div>as visitors come to see what\xe2\x80\x99s in africa some safari operators\xe2\x80\x99 profits head offshore. each year tourists cross the plains of central zimbabwe to sleep near the roar of victoria falls track elephants cheetahs and pangolins and dine under the stars.  the visitors are accompanied every step of the way by john stevens a man who has been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/992/africas-10-best-safari-guides.html">called</a> \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the finest guide to come out of zimbabwe.\xe2\x80\x9d  and while stevens\xe2\x80\x99 <a href="http://www.johnstevenssafaris.com/">safari business</a> is very much zimbabwean his financial universe is a classic creation of offshore globetrotting.  stevens\xe2\x80\x99 financial affairs outlined in years of correspondence with mossack fonseca the law firm at the center of the panama papers scandal reveal how the poetry of africa\xe2\x80\x99s savannahs mixes with the day-to-day paper-pushing of offshore management. <div class="image article__image image--medium image--floatright" id="3508"><div class="image__headline">    <div

href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10149528">stevens\xe2\x80\x99 guided safaris africa inc.</a> was headquartered on paper in the british virgin islands a speck of land in the caribbean nearly 100 times smaller than zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s largest safari reserve. it was set up to manage the stevens\xe2\x80\x99 family wealth and to act as a booking agent for an estimated $250000 a year in \xe2\x80\x9csafari revenue\xe2\x80\x9d according to files received by mossack fonseca. the company held a bank account in the isle of man an offshore financial center in the irish sea between great britain and ireland and was owned by stevens\xe2\x80\x99 family trust. stevens\xe2\x80\x99 company is one of at least 30 offshore african safari businesses created by mossack fonseca according to an analysis of the panama-based law firm\xe2\x80\x99s records. while most of them are officially based in the british virgin islands their day-to-day ventures are safaris that operate across southern and eastern africa from namibia through zimbabwe and botswana up into tanzania and kenya. one operator could be found as far north as egypt offering a steel-hull pleasure yacht for a \xe2\x80\x9clive-aboard diving safari\xe2\x80\x9d in the red sea.  mossack fonseca is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest creators of offshore companies businesses that have few or no employees and are usually located not where the company operates but where taxes are low or secrecy is high. the firm told icij that \xe2\x80\x9cwe merely help incorporate companies and before we agree to work with a client in any way we conduct a thorough due-diligence process one that in every case meets and quite often exceeds all relevant local rules regulations and standards.\xe2\x80\x9d <div class="image

sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw 800px"></div>tourists who come to africa to view the continent\xe2\x80\x99s beauty may think that their dollars euros and yen stay in local economies but this may not always be the case. the activities of some safari companies created by mossack fonseca in secrecy-conscious tax havens like the british virgin islands \xe2\x80\x93 which are known in shorthand as the bvi \xe2\x80\x93 concern transparency advocates and some governments that rely on tourism as a source of official revenue.  \xe2\x80\x9cin general there is no legitimate reason why a tourism operator would need to route their transaction via a highly secretive jurisdiction such as the bvi\xe2\x80\x9d said savior mwambwa a tax reform campaigner at actionaid international. \xe2\x80\x9cthere is also nothing special about the tourism sector in africa which would warrant offshore arrangements for payments from abroad. &#8230; i can\xe2\x80\x99t see any legitimate reason to channel bookings through the bvi and the isle of man apart from tax minimization.\xe2\x80\x9d  stevens did not respond to repeated requests for comment. fifty-six million visitors came to africa in 2014 according to the <a href="http://cf.cdn.unwto.org/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_annual_report_2014.pdf">united nations</a>. in some countries such as in john stevens\xe2\x80\x99 zimbabwe safaris and other kinds of tourism represent up to 5 percent of the gross domestic product. alvin mosioma executive director of the advocacy group tax justice network \xe2\x80\x93 africa  said tourism is a sector that\xe2\x80\x99s prone to questionable tax practices because it is \xe2\x80\x9calmost impossible\xe2\x80\x9d to nail down a market value for services. that makes it easy for companies involved in the industry to book profits and costs in a way that shifts their tax burdens to low- or no-tax jurisdictions he said. the offshore system\xe2\x80\x99s global sprawl provides plenty of choice in how to structure a financial scheme. in 2013 representatives of a bvi-based company called nature trails international limited wrote to its registered agent mossack fonseca to discuss its accounts. the company \xe2\x80\x9creceives payment from bookings for tours and travel in east africa and from time to time contracts to pay local kenyan tour operators for their services\xe2\x80\x9d a business plan shared with mossack fonseca explained. nature trail\xe2\x80\x99s sole shareholder was a company based in the secretive island nation of mauritius where nature trails also owned a bank account.  the company\xe2\x80\x99s business plan said it sought to take advantage of tourism\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmomentum of rapid growth in the eastern african countries during the recent years.\xe2\x80\x9d the company was dissolved in 2014 for reasons not specified in mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s files. a second company far horizons (1998) limited existed \xe2\x80\x9cto organize design and sell safari expeditions and adventures\xe2\x80\x9d through africa. this company also held a bank account in mauritius.  yet another company safaris inc. was incorporated in the seychelles and held bank accounts in luxembourg.  a fourth company operating in namibia was headquartered in the bvi owned a bank account in liechtenstein and held meetings in switzerland.  <script async defer

shares in at least four companies created by mossack fonseca. the first <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10167196">gerard pasanisi safari corp.</a> was created in the 1980s and used a swiss bank account to pay routine bills from mossack fonseca. pasanisi\xe2\x80\x99s string of offshore companies remained active with mossack fonseca into 2015. they included a dubai-based company tanganyika expeditions ltd. which banked in switzerland and which and carried out \xe2\x80\x9cphotographic safaris\xe2\x80\x9d in tanzania. lawyers for eric pasinisi gerard pasanisi\xe2\x80\x99s son and the manager of the businesses told icij that the four companies are currently administered from the united arab emirates and that their legal and tax statuses are transparent in both the uae and tanzania. at the time the companies were incorporated lawyers said bvi and panama were \xe2\x80\x9cthe most popular and recognized jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyers said \xe2\x80\x9cthe companies regularly fulfill all their respective tax obligations in both countries.\xe2\x80\x9d   above the border in kenya one of the leading safari dynasties the carr-hartley family asked mossack fonseca in 2001 to help create safariland inc.  according to a prospectus shared with mossack fonseca in 2013 safariland inc. helped deliver \xe2\x80\x9cextreme comfort with a taste of wild places off the tourist beat where one can feel the rhythm and heartbeat of wild africa yet want for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10088944">safariland inc.</a> was based in the british virgin islands and used directors-for-hire with no connection to the kenyan family.  it shares the name of the company to which potential tourists are encouraged to contact the carr-hartley family online. safariland inc. expected to make half a million dollars a year the carr-hartleys told mossack fonseca in documents sent in 2013. <div class="image article__image image--medium
