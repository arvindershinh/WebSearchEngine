<div><div><h2>Tax Haven Mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 Rise Comes At The Rest of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Expense</h2></div><div>companies are rushing to the island nation to benefit from secrecy and tax benefits.  jean-claude bastos de morais was trying to invest offshore but was having a hard time finding a place to put his money. the 50-year-old swiss-angolan financier turned to appleby an elite law firm with offices in tax havens around the globe. first bastos tried <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">appleby\xe2\x80\x99s office</a> on the island of jersey a popular offshore financial center in the english channel. but appleby employees there balked at his 2011 request to set up a shell company without being told why it was needed or what assets it would hold. one thing that concerned appleby\xe2\x80\x99s jersey lawyers was the possibility that the shell company would own a shipping port in corruption-prone angola. next bastos an amateur tennis player who runs an asset-management firm quantum global group tried appleby\xe2\x80\x99s office on the isle of man in the irish sea. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s management there decided that appleby would require a seat on the offshore company\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors to exercise some supervision over what they described as his high-risk business. the arrangement did not go ahead. finally in 2013 after angola\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign wealth fund entrusted bastos with $5 billion he turned to another appleby outpost: mauritius an island nation in the indian ocean 1200 miles off the east coast of southern africa. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are pleased to be able to act on your behalf\xe2\x80\x9d appleby\xe2\x80\x99s top lawyer in mauritius malcolm moller wrote to bastos\xe2\x80\x99 quantum global in october 2013. the warm email welcome for bastos\xe2\x80\x99 business is one of more than <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">half a million secret records</a>\xc2\xa0from appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office that were obtained by the german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and 94 media partners around the world. <a href="http://icij.org/investigations/paradisepapers">the paradise papers</a> come from the offshore law firm appleby and corporate services provider estera two businesses that operated together under the appleby name until estera became independent in 2016. the emails bank account applications powerpoint presentations on tax avoidance and other confidential documents open a window into the operations of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s 40-plus-employee operation in mauritius; by extension they illuminate the surprising importance of mauritius an island nation with a multiethnic population of 1.3 million as a hub in the secretive offshore financial network that enables legitimate humdrum business to thrive but also helps wealthy people and profitable businesses shield their assets and profits from taxation. using an array of complex schemes and companies that are little more than addresses on a piece of paper this global system has helped corporations shift $100 billion to $300 billion a year in tax revenue away from developing countries according to the international monetary fund. offshore business transactions and the use of tax havens are often legal but governments and representatives of civil society have increasingly criticized such behavior which helps impoverish african governments and widen wealth inequality between the region and the rest of the world. research shows that companies are more likely to use questionable tax avoidance maneuvers when operating in developing countries than in wealthier countries where tax enforcement is stronger. african countries are vulnerable to tax avoidance and evasion because corporate taxes contribute more to africa\xe2\x80\x99s overall tax revenue on a relative basis than such taxes do for other countries. \xe2\x80\x9csome of the most important ways of stripping profits from african countries are done through offshore jurisdictions including mauritius\xe2\x80\x9d said alexander ezenagu an international tax researcher at the international centre for tax and development. the angolan sovereign wealth fund fundo soberano de angola or fsdea manages $5 billion on behalf of a country where despite its considerable oil wealth one in three people lives in povertyand where corruption among government elites is perceived to be widespread. since its launch in 2012 the fsdea has come under scrutiny because of its structure and concerns about how it is managed. its chairman jos\xc3\xa9 filomeno dos santos was appointed by his father then president of angola jos\xc3\xa9 eduardo dos santos who led the country from 1979 until this year. the younger dos santos\xe2\x80\x99 appointment of bastos a personal friend to manage the fund \xe2\x80\x93 which included billions of dollars set aside for investment in africa and that would use companies in mauritius \xe2\x80\x93 drew the attention of journalists. in a statement to icij the fsdea said \xe2\x80\x9cquantum global was selected because of its exemplary performance on previous mandates with the angolan authorities its availability to carry out capacity building programs and commitment to develop a regional private equity management partnership with fsdea.\xe2\x80\x9d in a separate statement quantum global denied that the relationship between bastos and the angolan president\xe2\x80\x99s son influenced the fsdea\xe2\x80\x99s selection. quantum global told icij that its selection was due to its \xe2\x80\x9cexpertise investing in the continent\xe2\x80\x9d and its having outperformed other fund managers. the appleby records show that the law firm did its own research on its new client. a compilation of internet search results compiled in january 2014 by an employee at appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office included media references to lingering \xe2\x80\x9cquestions\xe2\x80\x9d about how the fund would operate. the appleby employee highlighted in yellow an article included in the search results that noted the \xe2\x80\x9cclose personal\xe2\x80\x9d friendship between bastos and dos santos. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s customer-screening process also flagged media accounts of bastos\xe2\x80\x99 past legal problems in switzerland. records show that appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office had classified bastos as a \xe2\x80\x9crisky client \xe2\x80\x9d but moved forward with its new business. the first step was getting a coveted mauritius business license. in a letter accompanying quantum global\xe2\x80\x99s license application appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office told regulators that it had \xe2\x80\x9cmade all reasonable enquiries\xe2\x80\x9d into bastos quantum global and their plans to manage the angolan money. on the application form \xe2\x80\x93 supplementing a question about whether any company director had been convicted penalized or sanctioned in court \xe2\x80\x93 a summary was appended in which his personal lawyer disclosed that bastos had paid a $5390 fine after a swiss court convicted him in 2011 of approving loans that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. bastos\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer however failed to mention that the swiss court had also imposed a suspended fine of nearly $188646. the application form also didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that the swiss court also found bastos guilty of withdrawing about $100000 from a company account without authorization according to a copy of the judgment obtained by icij media partner sonntagszeitung. bastos acknowledged the suspended fine but told icij that the larger of the two fines did not have to be paid under a good conduct probation provision. bastos said the suspended fine and convictions have since been expunged from switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s register of convictions. \xe2\x80\x9cthe authorities were informed correctly\xe2\x80\x9d bastos said. with the license approved appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office helped bastos and his company move some angolan public funds slated for the management of investments in african hotels and infrastructure. the money moved through offshore companies in three jurisdictions \xe2\x80\x93 including some incorporated in mauritius known for its low taxes and high tolerance for secrecy. i<span style="font-size: 16px;">n an email sent to appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius employees to remind them of the sensitivity of their new client quantum global\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer wrote \xe2\x80\x93 in boldface type \xe2\x80\x93 that a british virgin islands company called red sahara ltd. (later renamed qg investments ltd.) which would later receive tens of millions of dollars in dividends was ultimately owned by bastos. the information was \xe2\x80\x9chighly con\xef\xac\x81dential\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cthat is to say please do not share any information.\xe2\x80\x9d</span> the angola fund once paid $20 million for shares in a company incorporated in the british virgin islands capoinvest which was helping to finance the development of a major port in northern angola. in its 2014 annual report angola\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign wealth fund twice mentions capoinvest which also owns the angolan company that is developing the port. there is no mention however of the additional offshore companies that own capoinvest. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files reveal it is owned by a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164973-infrastructure-africa.html">chain of three companies incorporated</a> in the british virgin islands and two more in the seychelles in the indian ocean <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164973-infrastructure-africa.html">all of them ultimately owned by bastos</a>. in his statement bastos said quantum global complies \xe2\x80\x9cin all countries with legal tax and regulatory standards.\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9ci have routinely disclosed my shareholding in capoinvest.\xe2\x80\x9d mauritius also provided a low-tax haven for substantial fees the angolan fund paid bastos\xe2\x80\x99 operation. the financial statements of qg investments africa management ltd. bastos\xe2\x80\x99 mauritius company show it received $63.2 million in management fees throughout 2015 of which $21.9 million was sent to a quantum global company in switzerland. \xe2\x80\x9cthe fees seem extraordinarily high\xe2\x80\x9d said andrew bauer an economic analyst and sovereign wealth fund expert who reviewed the fee payments. records show one bastos-owned company paying dividends to another. in 2014 and 2015 qg investments africa management paid $41 million in dividends to his qg investments based in the british virgin islands. bastos told icij that quantum global was paid advisory fees \xe2\x80\x9caccording to standard industry practices all of which have been and continue to be fully disclosed.\xe2\x80\x9d he said that \xe2\x80\x9cas any other shareholder i am earning dividends out of the distributions of my companies.\xe2\x80\x9d he said his ownership of qg investments africa management is tax-efficient. bastos declined to comment on \xe2\x80\x9cconfidential business matters\xe2\x80\x9d that led him to approach appleby offices in jersey and the isle of man. bastos said quantum global chose mauritius because of its its low taxes \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent infrastructure relaxed reforms\xe2\x80\x9d and advantageous tax treaties known as \xe2\x80\x9cdouble taxation agreements\xe2\x80\x9d with most african countries. mauritius is an island of white coral beaches and low mountains in the indian ocean. colonized first by the dutch then the french and the english mauritius was for centuries used mostly to grow sugar cane originally cultivated by slaves from the african region and asia. the island diversified into textiles and tourism but sugar held sway even after mauritius which is considered part of africa gained independence in 1968. \xe2\x80\x9csugar was king\xe2\x80\x9d said hassen auleear 58 a cane farmer in northern mauritius. auleear represents the third generation of his family to grow sugar cane \xe2\x80\x93 and his generation will be the last. financial support for sugar farmers has dwindled and every year hundreds of them pack up and walk off land they have owned for decades. today sugar accounts for just over 1 percent of the economy. glass-clad towers in a suburb of the capital port louis house banks accounting firms and law firms. the high-rises sit on what were once some of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most fertile cane fields. and none of auleear\xe2\x80\x99s children intend to follow him into farming. two of his daughters are accountants one in ebene cybercity the financial center. auleear said that the mauritius government has abandoned sugar cane farmers and that the country looks down on those with dirt under their fingernails. \xe2\x80\x9cthey think that people wearing a neck tie a good shirt and shoes sitting in an air-conditioned office is just fine\xe2\x80\x9d auleear said. in 1989 the government embarked on a plan to turn the island into a hub for investment from all corners of the world. the island positioned itself as the \xe2\x80\x9cgateway to africa\xe2\x80\x9d for foreign corporations touting africa as \xe2\x80\x9can unfathomed mine of opportunities next door.\xe2\x80\x9d the 1992 mauritius offshore business activities act created corporate vehicles known as global business companies which enabled non-mauritians to incorporate there with little fuss and limited public disclosure. the island slashed its taxes and entered into tax treaties with neighboring african nations and others. the double taxation agreements (dtas) were sold to treaty partners as a development tool that would encourage investment in those countries by the growing number of global companies incorporating in mauritius. in theory dtas are supposed to help companies avoid being taxed twice on the same economic activity. in practice however signing a dta with a low or no-tax country such as mauritius means that some taxes may not be applied at all. businesses rushed to set up subsidiary companies in mauritius and began to take advantage of tax treaties between mauritius and other countries by channeling revenue through the island haven a practice that has come to be known as \xe2\x80\x9ctreaty shopping.\xe2\x80\x9d by 2000 the country\xe2\x80\x99s offshore financial industry had become as described by the international monetary fund \xe2\x80\x9cenormous.\xe2\x80\x9d global businesses based on the island have assets valued at more than $630 billion 50 times the amount of mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 gross domestic product. \xe2\x80\x9conly luxembourg has a bigger stock of foreign direct investment relative to the size of its economy\xe2\x80\x9daccording to the financial times. in recent years mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 african neighbors have complained that the island\xe2\x80\x99s gains have come at their expense and they have taken their case to the international community. in 2013 the u.n. economic commission on africa criticized the island as \xe2\x80\x9ca relatively financially secretive conduit\xe2\x80\x9d that contributes to poverty on the continent. in 2015 the european commission temporarily placed mauritius on a top 30 blacklist of tax havens. last year mauritius made nonprofit oxfam\xe2\x80\x99s list of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 15 worst tax havens. &#8220;while the full scale of tax losses from treaty shopping are shrouded in secrecy countries in africa are potentially losing a fortune&#8221; said attiya waris a tax law expert at the university of nairobi. <iframe src="https://projects.icij.org/paradise-papers/mauritius/#/" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> mauritius\xe2\x80\x99s tax treaties withstood a landmark challenge in 2012 when india\xe2\x80\x99s supreme court ruled that the indian government couldn\xe2\x80\x99t collect $2.2 billion from cell phone giant vodafone\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of an indian operating company through offshore firms including one in mauritius. the way the purchase was structured had the effect of sidestepping indian taxes. government agencies in mauritius responded to icij questions with an 11-page statement that denied that the island is a tax haven or secretive. where necessary the agencies said mauritius will continue to enhance the country\xe2\x80\x99s transparency and strengthen rules against tax evasion terrorist financing money laundering and corruption. the agencies also said that no party to a treaty can impose conditions on the other and that a treaty is a \xe2\x80\x9cwin-win situation\xe2\x80\x9d for both sides. mauritius does not intentionally deny taxing rights to other african countries the agencies said; some countries choose to forgo taxes to attract foreign investment. appleby opened its doors in downtown port louis in 2007. the law firm occupies the top floors of a prominent building above the busy shopfronts of modest clothing stores selling such items as superman and homer simpson boxer shorts. secrecy on mauritius is one of the office\xe2\x80\x99s selling points. the mauritius government maintains a corporate registry of more than 20000 companies chartered on the island and keeps most information about them strictly confidential. the leaked appleby records show that the firm administered a trust fund worth more than $100 million for a european princess who told the firm that she would not send any emails and would keep calls to a minimum because an internal memo said \xe2\x80\x9cshe did not want any trail.\xe2\x80\x9d in april 2014 a south african-based investor luca bechis asked appleby to create a mauritius company that would buy mineral concentrate from mines in mozambique. the plan was to send \xe2\x80\x9cany positive balance\xe2\x80\x9d offshore in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting fees\xe2\x80\x9d he said. bechis told appleby that he wanted to make sure that no tax would be paid in mauritius \xe2\x80\x93 and that his name would not appear on corporate records. \xe2\x80\x9ci don&#8217;t want my involvement to be disclosed for privacy reasons\xe2\x80\x9d bechis wrote. in an email bechis told icij that mauritius was one offshore alternative considered to hold mines across africa and that it was legally vetted to comply with tax rules. bechis said that the kidnapping risk faced by wealthy people and their families was behind his request for privacy. from the start appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office has emphasized the services it offers to companies seeking to reduce or eliminate the tax burdens on their operations in africa. potential clients receive a full-color 50-page guide that extols mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 tax treaties. thirteen of the 36 treaties on

operating in mozambique with $10 million in interest payments due to be paid to its parent company in singapore. if the money went from mozambique directly to singapore the presentation explained mozambique would take $2 million in taxes. with the payments shunted through a company incorporated in mauritius however a treaty between the two countries would slash the tax owed mozambique by more than half. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164976-presentation-overview-of-the-global-business.html">mozambique receives $800000</a> and the company assuming the operation in mauritius costs $30000 saves $1.17 million. countries are giving up \xe2\x80\x9c5 10 or 15 percent of revenue from a deal. that\xe2\x80\x99s a very significant amount of money\xe2\x80\x9d said catherine ngina mutava associate director of the strathmore tax research centre at strathmore law school in nairobi kenya. for officials in mauritius mutava said \xe2\x80\x9cultimately \xe2\x80\xa6 their state comes first even if it means that other african countries suffer in the process. in 2012 pacific andes resources development ltd. one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest producers of fish oil and fish meal moved into the lucrative namibian horse mackerel market. the bluish-green or gray fish is so important to namibia\xe2\x80\x99s identity and economy that the country\xe2\x80\x99s 5-cent coin features an engraving of one over the injunction: \xe2\x80\x9chorse mackerel: eat more fish.\xe2\x80\x9d the company had come under scrutiny before arriving in namibia. since the early 2000s reports by experts international organizations and tribunals had alleged that pacific andes was operating an illegal fishing ring in the pacific ocean. a 2002 report by members of the fishing industry alleged that pacific andes used unlicensed boats to poach fish near antarctica \xe2\x80\x9con a scale never seen before.\xe2\x80\x9d pacific andes denied wrongdoing. the company told icij that it improved internal controls to comply with sustainability and health requirements. pacific andes had made powerful friends inside namibia and partnered with a local operation atlantic pacific fishing (pty) ltd. to catch the mackerel. atlantic pacific fishing was no ordinary company; documents obtained by the namibian newspaper and shared with icij reveal that its directors included namibia\xe2\x80\x99s deputy minister of lands deputy secretary of higher education a former capital city mayor as well as advisers to namibia\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister and president. in 2012 appleby did its part by helping pacific andes headquartered in bermuda set up a subsidiary in mauritius. the new company brandberg (mauritius) investment holdings ltd. received a government-issued tax certificate the same year that would allow the company to benefit from the two countries\xe2\x80\x99 double taxation agreement. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4176192-brandberg-tax-residence-certificate.html">under the treaty</a> the company could potentially cut some future tax payments in half. pacific andes conducted much of its business in mauritius and namibia through a subsidiary in the cayman islands china fishery group ltd. files from appleby\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius office and court documents obtained by icij show that pacific andes used several offshore companies including a mauritius company \xe2\x80\x93 brandberg which had no employees \xe2\x80\x93 to direct fees and payments from high-tax namibia into low-tax jurisdictions. in august 2013 for instance a company in the british virgin islands leased a fishing boat to brandberg in mauritius for $31700 a day. brandberg then chartered the boat named sheriff to atlantic pacific fishing in namibia. later that year brandberg and atlantic pacific fishing signed a contract under which brandberg managed the namibian company\xe2\x80\x99s ships employees and mackerel trade in exchange for a management fee of 4 percent of the value of fish sales. atlantic pacific fishing paid $1.25 million in boat chartering fees to brandberg in mauritius over more than two years according to atlantic pacific fishing\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 annual report obtained by the namibian newspaper. annual reports also show that the namibian company paid nearly $2 million in management fees to brandberg between 2013 and 2014 and owed the mauritius company outstanding bills totaling more than $8 million. all of it was purportedly earned by a mauritius company with no office of its own. alexander ezenagu an international tax researcher said payments to a shell company in mauritius could significantly reduce the amount of money that a company like atlantic pacific fishing has to pay taxes on in namibia. \xe2\x80\x9cthe structures are geared at stripping profits\xe2\x80\x9d from high-tax jurisdictions he said. in response to icij questions pacific andes said namibian shareholders received more than four times the value of management fees paid to the mauritius company and the majority of fees stayed in namibia as working capital. atlantic pacific fishing also employed more than 100 namibians pacific andes said. in 2016 the pacific andes subsidiary and brandberg\xe2\x80\x99s owner china fishery filed for bankruptcy protection in new york. a court-appointed trustee is trying to collect millions of dollars to restructure the company and repay china fishery\xe2\x80\x99s debts. this year the trustee told the court that he had a \xe2\x80\x9chigh degree of concern\xe2\x80\x9d about the company\xe2\x80\x99s accounting practices. the trustee found one entry of $18.8 million listed in a subsidiary company\xe2\x80\x99s accounts but could find no evidence that the purported sale accounting for the entry ever took place. the trustee put sheriff the fishing boat up for sale. pacific andes said it had clarified and resolved the $18.8 million accounting entry with the trustee. after years of bad publicity and some behind-the-scenes diplomacy mauritius has taken steps to reform its offshore sector. to discourage misuse of offshore companies authorities introduced requirements that such companies become more active in mauritius \xe2\x80\x93 which would include having employees and meetings there. in july mauritius signed a global anti-tax-avoidance treatyand agreed to review half of its double taxation agreements. jean-claude bastos and his company were aware of african countries\xe2\x80\x99 growing intolerance of mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 letterbox companies and sensed the shift in the public mood in africa. when bastos\xe2\x80\x99 swiss asset-management company was considering options to avoid taxes in countries where the sovereign wealth fund might invest  a lawyer for quantum global wrote to a tax accountant in 2014 about where one of the employees would work. \xe2\x80\x9cwe understand that it certainly looks better to have the manager in mauritius\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are pushing back here.\xe2\x80\x9d the email suggested that the company was willing to take its chances. if other countries objected to quantum global\xe2\x80\x99s use of mauritius to reduce its tax bills across africa the letter said it would deal with the problem \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d critics remain skeptical of mauritius\xe2\x80\x99 reform efforts. the country rejected major elements of the global anti-tax-avoidance treaty including an amendment that would have allowed african countries to collect more taxes when corporations bought and sold land through mauritian companies. mauritius chose to renegotiate some double taxation agreements particularly those with other african countries on a one-on-one basis instead of through the global treaty. the new global rules might \xe2\x80\x9ckill a few of the problematic elements but it won\xe2\x80\x99t really change anything in the near future for most african countries\xe2\x80\x9d the strathmore tax research centre\xe2\x80\x99s catherine mutava said. \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s like putting a band-aid on a huge leak. i don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything changing soon.\xe2\x80\x9d <em><strong>contributors to this story: christian br\xc3\xb6nnimann and
