<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>it seems two global proxy firms with impeccable credentials put out recommendations against the re-appointment of deepak parekh to hdfc ltd  a company he has led for close to three decades and someone who is iconic in his stature as a corporate citizen.institutional shareholder services inc is a global proxy advisory firm which has a three-decade history and is often known as “the gold standard” in its field. set up in 1985  iss  pioneered “the development of policy-based proxy voting recommendations and online voting”  the firm claims on its website. its mandate is to help shareholders manage “portfolio company governance risk and drive value.”iss has 19 offices worldwide  covers 115 markets and has over 1900 institutional clients. it covers over 20 000 companies globally. it executes more than 9.6 million ballots representing 3.7 trillion shares globally  according to information on its website.the firm has 16-page india voting proxy guidelines where upfront it mentions that the general recommendation is to “vote for the election of the directors” unless there are issues which the firm clubs under the two buckets of independence and composition. this document was updated on january 10  2018 and is effective for meetings beyond february 1  2018.composition refers to the inability of the nominee director to attend more than three quarters of board and key committee meetings without what it calls a “satisfactory explanation.”the firm also puts in a caveat that “in making any of the above recommendations on the election of directors  iss generally will not recommend against the election of a ceo  managing director  executive chairman  or founder whose removal from the board would be expected to have a material negative impact on shareholder value.”glass lewis  the other firm which put out a “nay” for parekh is a portfolio company of the ontario teachers’ pension plan board (“otpp”) and alberta investment management corp. (“aimco”).headquartered in san francisco  glass lewis covers more than 20 000 meetings across 100 global markets and has a client base of over 1300  according to information on its website.“corporate governance has evolved from something that happens just once a year at a company’s annual meeting to a year-round process ” the firm formed by a group of finance  accounting and legal professionals in 2003 says.glass lewis has a 32-pager on proxy paper guidelines which detail its approach to proxy advice in india on its website and it is updated for 2018. its revisions for india come under three heads of director independence  equity-based compensation and the amended listing obligations and disclosure requirements.“we have updated our consideration of a director's independence  based on prior employment as an executive and/or whole-time director. we will apply a three-year look-back period for all past relationships ” the paper mentions.the paper continues to point out that the firm will look at other directorships and how it checks for independence in the indian context. a director in a non-executive capacity who has been employed by the company as a senior executive will be considered to be independent only if there has been a break of at least three years between leaving that employment  the firm points out in its note. performance  shareholder value and the correct tone at the top are the main drivers for glass lewis’ research and advice.the firm  however  clearly points out that it is not in favour of upsetting the apple cart where it does not help in improving governance.“we will generally refrain from recommending voting against directors at companies where they also serve as ceo  executive chairperson  or a combined ceo-executive chairperson  since a vote against such top executive may be interpreted as an indication of loss of confidence in the executive when the real concern is the executive’s over-commitment of other board seats outside the executive role ” the firm says in its india-specific note.deepak parekh has  however  seen this play before. according to news reports  hdfc’s long time partner  standard life voted against him in case of his directorship in vedanta five years ago in a similar case.if the two proxy firms go by their public disclosed policies on voting for directors  the vote against parekh seems to be a considered vote. it seems brutal rules-based governance is here.</div></div>
