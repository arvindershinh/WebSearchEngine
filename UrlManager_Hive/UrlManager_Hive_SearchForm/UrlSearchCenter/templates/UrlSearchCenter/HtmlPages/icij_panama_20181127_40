<div><div><h2>US Officials React to Panama Papers Disclosures With Get-Tough Proposals</h2></div><div>the obama administration has proposed a national registry documenting the real owners of shell companies and other measures aimed at fighting offshore chicanery. in the wake of the public firestorm sparked by the panama papers scandal the obama administration unveiled a series of new proposals today that would crack down on offshore secrecy and illicit financial transactions. in a news conference this afternoon administration officials announced that the u.s. treasury department would send proposed legislation to congress that would require companies set up in the united states to report their real owners to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s financial crimes enforcement network. this would for the first time create a national registry that could be used by law enforcement authorities to ferret out the real people behind anonymous companies used in money laundering and other wrongdoing. the proposal acknowledges the reality that the u.s. itself is a key player in the system of offshore secrecy through such states as delaware nevada and <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article70008302.html">wyoming</a> that allow the creation of shell companies that hide their owners\xe2\x80\x99 identities and activities. wally adeyemo the u.s. deputy national security advisor for international economics said the obama administration has been working hard for years to address the issue of offshore-fueled misconduct but that the panama papers disclosures \xe2\x80\x9chighlight the fact that more needs to be done\xe2\x80\x9d to fight money laundering terrorism financing and tax evasion.   \xe2\x80\x9cour financial system should not provide the rich the powerful and the corrupt with the opportunity to shield their assets and avoid paying their fair share or with the opportunity to hide any illicit activity\xe2\x80\x9d adeyemo said. \xe2\x80\x9cnobody should be able to hide in shadows from their legal obligations and nobody should be able to play by a different set of rules.\xe2\x80\x9d adeyemo noted that u.s. investigations have prompted 80 swiss banks to admit to \xe2\x80\x9cengaging in tax evasion and related criminal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and forced them to pay more than $1.3 billion in penalties. in addition he said the u.s. tax amnesty program has prompted more than 54000 taxpayers \xe2\x80\x9cto do the right thing and resolve their past non-compliance\xe2\x80\x9d and has collected more than $8 billion in the process. treasury secretary jacob lew <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2824376-us-transparency-announcement-secretary-lew.html">sent a letter</a> today to u.s. house speaker paul ryan urging congress to pass the legislation creating a central ownership registry for shell companies.  lew also asked senate leaders to take action to approve eight tax treaties that the u.s. has negotiated with other countries agreements that would allow better sharing of information with other governments about americans holding assets overseas. he noted that american tax treaties with two well-known tax havens switzerland and luxembourg have been waiting for senate approval for more than five years. the u.s. justice department said in a new release today that it will submit proposals to congress in an effort to improve enforcement of laws targeting the illegal proceeds of transnational corruption. the proposals would make it easier for u.s. law enforcement authorities to file charges against corrupt foreign officials and subpoena records in money laundering investigations. in pushing these new measures u.s. officials are joining others from around the world who have announced <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160405-global-response.html">investigations and policy reforms</a> in reaction to reporting on the panama papers by the international consortium of investigative journalists german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and more than 100 other media partners. on april 5 two days after the panama papers investigation first broke germany&#39;s justice minister <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/germany-wants-a-transparency-register-after-panama-papers-leaks-2016-4">called for</a> the creation of a national \xe2\x80\x9ctransparency register\xe2\x80\x9d that would document the real owners of shell companies sent up within his country. u.k. prime minister david cameron meanwhile is expected to propose a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/cameron-to-propose-global-anti-corruption-agency-at-summit">new global anti-corruption agency</a> that would investigative money laundering and tax dodging.</div></div>
