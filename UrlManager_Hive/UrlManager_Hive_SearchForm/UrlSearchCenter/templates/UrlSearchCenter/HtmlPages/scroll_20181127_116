<div><div><h2>ONGC woes: How Modi government drove India s most profitable company under a mountain of debt</h2></div><div>not too long ago india s largest crude oil and natural gas exploration company the oil and natural gas corporation owned by the government was not only debt-free but the country s most profitable company. it was also among one of the most cash-rich companies in the country.this has changed. after successive governments had gradually milked ongc the oil and gas explorer has completely run dry after the narendra modi government took over.ongc a public sector enterprise developed in the late 1950s and 1960s is key to india s energy security.of course the congress regimes since the early 1990s chipped away at the company in favour of private businesses looking to dig into the inordinately profitable oil and gas industry. in 1992- 93 a total of 28 prime oil and gas fields that were discovered and developed by ongc were given away to private parties for a pittance.in fact the indian government in 1991 forced ongc to take a loan of $450 million from the world bank with attached conditions mandating that oil fields discovered by ongc and oil india another state-owned enterprise would have to be developed as joint ventures with private and foreign capital.but ongc remained among the top cash-rich companies of india contributing around 70% to india s domestic production.reserves are exhaustedover the past four years however as the bharatiya janata party-led regime under narendra modi has continued to suck out cash from profitable public-sector companies in  inventive  ways ongc has not only exhausted its accumulated cash reserves but is now under a mountain of debt thanks to unnecessary acquisitions that it was forced to make by this government.last november the oil ministry pushed to sell 60% stake in the prime oil and gas producing fields of ongc to private companies but the attempt was unsuccessful owing to strong opposition from the state-run company.the company s financials as reflected in its yearly balance sheets (which can accessed from its annual reports) for the past four fiscals are instructive. they tell the story of ongc s downhill slide which is not just sorry but scary for india s energy future.what the financials saythis june bloomberg reported that ongc s cash levels in the year ended march 2018 were at their lowest since the year ended march 2001 and had dropped by more than 90% in one year from financial year 2017 to financial year 2018.a look at the balance sheets corroborates this.below is the cash with ongc (counted here as cash and cash equivalents + other bank balances + current financial investments) over the past five years until 2017- 18.in 2014- 15 the first fiscal after modi came to power in mid-2014 there was a fall of around 74% in the cash levels from the year before. cash reserves are used for capital expenditure which is massive for oil and gas companies undertaking exploration of hydrocarbon reserves. cash reserves are also used for paying the annual dividends a share of the profit earned by a company paid to its shareholders.this is the same year when ongc was overtaken by mukesh ambani s reliance industries as india s most profitable company. ongc had posted a consolidated net profit of rs 18334 crore that year and slipped to the third position.there was recovery in the cash levels in 2015- 16 and 2016- 17. however from 2016- 17 to 2017- 18 the company s cash levels dropped steeply by 92%.there are a number of reasons why this happened.dividend payoutsongc has been among the highest dividend-paying public-sector companies. but the government has been treating it as a cash cow and has been regularly extracting extra or special dividends from the company just as it does from other profitable public sector companies especially oil and gas companies.in 2013- 14 ongc paid a total dividend of rs 8127 crore and nearly the same sum the following year. in 2015- 16 ongc had a dividend payout of rs 8127 crore. in 2016- 17 the company paid a dividend of rs 7764 crore. however in 2017- 18 ongc paid its highest dividend ever of rs 8470 crore. all of these dividends mentioned here are without counting the dividend distribution tax paid.fuel subsidywhat s more ongc and other state-owned oil companies such as oil india limited have been regularly asked to share the fuel subsidy burden with the government refusing to pay the entire subsidy. so ongc had to pay for fuel subsidy   selling oil to refiners at a discount even as oil prices soared. this obviously cut into the profitability of the company.in 2014 the public sector explorer was asked to pay a record subsidy of rs 56384 crore an increase of 14% from the subsidy paid the previous fiscal so that state-owned fuel retailers could cover the losses incurred in 2013- 14.for just the quarter ended december 31 2014 the company was asked to pay rs 8716 crore. in june 2015 ongc and the oil india together contributed over 40% to the annual subsidy bill.the government had again been asking ongc to bear the fuel subsidy this time to bring down petrol prices but the company resisted and was exempted given its dire financial situation with ongc chairman shashi shanker admitting in june this year that the company was  already in the red .but how did ongc end up in the red while the high dividend payouts and fuel subsidies can explain the fall in ongc s cash and profitability in 2014- 15 what happened in 2017- 18 that the cash levels fell by 92% this is where we come to the two most destructive moves by the modi government as far as ongc s cash situation as well as its future is concerned   getting ongc to bail out the debt-ridden gujarat state petroleum corporation and to buy the central government s stake in the hindustan petroleum corporation limited.bailing out gspcin august 2017 ongc was made to acquire all of the 80% stake of the gujarat state petroleum corporation owned by the gujarat government in a gas block of the krishna godavarari basin off shore in bay of bengal for nearly rs 8000 crore.for this ongc paid around rs 7480 crore in 2017- 18 according to its website.the field was auctioned during 2003 under the erstwhile new exploration licensing policy which has now been replaced by the hyrdrocarbon exploration and licensing policy approved in march 2016. in 2005 the gujarat state petroleum corporation that the krishna godavarari basin block was the discovery of the century for india.however the block did not see any commercial production even by late 2015. the gujarat state petroleum corporation has debt of rs 19576 crore for which they pay interest of rs 1804.06 crore per year.so buying the block from is nothing but a losing proposition for ongc.buying hpcl after taking debtin january 2018 ongc was forced to acquire the central government s entire 51.11% equity stake in hindustan petroleum corporation limited only so that the modi government could meet its fiscal deficit target.in fact ongc was forced to buy the hindustan petroleum stake for rs 36915 crore at a price that was 14% higher than the market rate hpcl s closing share price on january 31 2018.most devastatingly this deal pushed ongc into high debt. it was compelled to borrow rs 35000 crore.ongc borrowed this sum as short-term (one-year) loans from four public sector banks and three private banks   rs 7340 crore from state bank of india; rs 4460 crore from bank of india; rs 10600 crore from punjab national bank; rs 1600 crore from export import bank of india; rs 4000 core from hdfc bank; rs 4000 crore from icici bank; and rs 3000 crore from axis bank.as per ongc s balance sheet for 2017- 18 the company has borrowings of rs 25592.2 crore.selling stake to pay off debtspeaking to newsclick on the condition of anonymity an ongc official and member of the ongc workers  union said the company was planning to raise money to pay off its debt by selling its shares in the state-owned indian oil corporation and gail.ongc has 13.77% shares in ioc and 4.86% shares in gail that were purchased under the government s buyback policy earlier.the official said ongc was planning to sell the ioc and gail stakes to the state-owned life insurance corporation of india. but lic put a condition that it would only buy the stakes at a concession of 10% as compared to the market rate  he said.  but ongc refused this and decided to sell in the market instead even though we won t realise the amount in one shot if we sell in the market. currently there are some technical problems that we are dealing with for selling in the market. so the sale is yet to happen. he added that  the management was planning to sell off ongc s stake in opal [ongc petro addition ltd] a new joint venture in gujarat. but the employees  union opposed the sale and requested the management to instead sell ioc and gail stake. given the extremely capital-intensive and high-risk nature of oil exploration the current situation is extremely dangerous for ongc s future. in any case cash reserves are required for capital expenditure which is critical for oil and gas companies to invest in exploration and production.as bloomberg says ongc has started work on its largest-ever oil and gas exploration project which will require investments of more than $5 billion over about four years.recently the modi government held the first auction of oil and gas exploration blocks in the country in eight years under the new and  liberalised  open acreage licensing policy and awarded 41 blocks out of 55 to anil agarwal s vedanta resources. ongc was given just two blocks. the ostensible reason that was reported in newspapers was that the bids made by ongc were  conservative  and showed  extraordinary risk-aversion .given the state ongc has been reduced to by the government is it any wonder that the country s largest crude oil and gas company is being risk-averse  ongc had been a debt-free company since 2001- 02  said the ongc official.  the cash reserves can be built up again but the company needs to become debt-free first. union in gujarat writes to modimeanwhile in a letter dated september 4 the ongc employees  mazdoor sabha in gujarat wrote to modi raising the issues of the gujarat state petroleum corporation and hindustan petroleum deals and stating that  constant interference  by the government had turned ongc from a  cash rich company to a high debt company . ongc officials have also asked the government to exempt the company from the share buyback plan.giving a notice of three months for the modi government to stop interfering in ongc s decision-making the union in its letter has warned of  resorting to any direct action as deemed fit by the confederation of trade unions in ongc without giving any further notice. this article first appeared on newsclick.</div></div>
