"the point is he (patel) has shown some spine at last. it was not there earlier " he said and noted that patel succeeded raghuram rajan.as part of the reconciliation process  each side will have to cede a bit  he said  adding rbi should make concessions on two of the most contentious issues by giving more money to small businesses and liberalising the prompt corrective action framework on 11 state-run banks.underlining that the central bank's autonomy is paramount  bajaj said  "nobody across the world disputes the need for autonomy and independence of the regulatory bodies. (but) that does not mean india can go to the dogs! (by starving the industry of funds)".wading into the debate started by finance minister arun jaitley  bajaj said the elected parliament is "supreme" and therefore  there is a talk of invoking section 7  which has never been used in the rbi's over 83-year-old history."i very much hope the independence of rbi will be retained  and section 7 will not be resorted to " he said  adding there cannot be 100 percent agreement at the board on certain aspects.bajaj said the "rightist and pro-government" s gurumurthy  who is reportedly triggered turf war between the two  is "very knowledgeable and sensible"  even though one may not agree with all his views.relations between rbi and finance ministry soured in the past month  after north block started consultations under the never-used section 7 of the rbi act which allows government to direct rbi to undertake certain measures "in public interest".according to sources  government has sent three letters to rbi on october 10  with nearly a dozen demands  which were replied to within a week by the central bank.government primarily wants rbi to help the struggling non-bank lenders get some liquidity support  liberalise the prompt corrective action norms on 11 banks and undertake other steps which will help spur growth  while rbi is said to be taking a conservative view on most of it and avoiding any bad precedents.rbi's perceived excess capital is also a contentious issue  with reports saying government is eyeing rs 3.6 trillion of the over rs 9.7 trillion of its reserves.denying any such demand  economic affairs secretary sc garg had last week said the attempt was to have a discussion on the "appropriate economic capital framework" for rbi.the central bank took its reservations on various issues public in a speech by deputy governor viral acharya on october 26  wherein he warned of investors' wrath if rbi's autonomy is compromised. the speech was delivered after an allegedly tumultuous rbi board meeting on october 19.after reports of invocation of under section 7 came up  government had tried to ease tension by stating that autonomy is "essential" and an accepted governance requirement.however  garg had also mocked the "wrath-of-the- markets" remark by acharya  pointing out to the improvements in financial markets since the speech.about his expectations from the forthcoming general elections  bajaj said we need a strong government and also a united opposition.he also welcomed the work done by nda government on various fronts  and decried those who criticise it for advertising its work.bajaj said despite its best intentions  the upa regime could not eradicate poverty or end other social issues on multiple fronts  including gender and added that such work takes time.addressing the awardees  bajaj lashed out at the rising inequalities in the society  stating that it is worse than poverty and warned that the bitterness that comes in a person struggling to get his day's meal on seeing an opulent wedding will lead to a "revolution".bajaj also made his displeasure at the laws created following the fleeing of willful defaulters and fraudsters by sebi and the corporate affairs ministry.</div></div>
