<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div>british prime minister david cameron has continued to try to defuse public anger over details of his offshore holdings announcing new steps to make the offshore world more transparent during an address to parliament on monday. addressing the house of commons on monday cameron pledged to create a cross agency task force to probe panama papers revelations and promised to push for new rules that would allow authorities to prosecute corporations that facilitate tax evasion. he also announced that most of the united kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s dependencies including the british virgin islands and the cayman islands have agreed to provide full access to information about the beneficial owners of offshore companies. the information would be made available to law enforcement and tax authorities but not necessarily to the public. \xe2\x80\x9cwe think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to go\xe2\x80\x9d the beleaguered cameron said and added that the u.k. dependencies should be recognized for how far they have gone in comparison to other secrecy jurisdictions.  \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re well ahead of some states in the united states of america\xe2\x80\x9d he said at one point. cameron who initially responded to information about his father\xe2\x80\x99s offshore investment fund with careful narrowly worded responses finally said last week that he had profited from shares in his father\xe2\x80\x99s blairmore fund shares of which he sold shortly before becoming prime minister.  cameron\xe2\x80\x99s <a
