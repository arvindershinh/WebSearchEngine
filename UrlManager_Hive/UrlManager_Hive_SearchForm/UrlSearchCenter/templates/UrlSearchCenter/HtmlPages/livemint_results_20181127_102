<div><div><h2>Expect IndiGo Q2 results to rub off on Jet Airways, SpiceJet as well</h2></div><div>the interglobe aviation ltd stock has declined 37% so far this fiscal. one reason was that the march and june quarter results were disappointing. the september quarter (q2) numbers will ensure investor frustration continues. profits are far worse than anticipated. interglobe runs indigo airlines which  while a analyst poll expected a much lower loss of  391 crore. costs increased much faster as crude oil prices remained elevated and the rupee depreciated. data from indigo s earnings presentation shows spreads (rask less cask) were negative in the quarter at  0.51 per available seat km (askm). this measure in the june and march quarters was at  0.01 per askm and  0.10 per askm respectively. rask is revenue per askm and a measurement of unit revenues whereas cask is cost per askm and a measurement of unit costs. performance was also hit on account of forex loss of  335 crore. also pricing offered no respite thanks to intense competition. yields declined by about a tenth compared to the same quarter last year.  similar to the last quarter the 0-15 day booking window remains weak with lower fares compared to the same period last year  interglobe said in its conference call. overall indigo s ebitdar or earnings before interest tax depreciation amortization and aircraft lease rentals declined sharply by 93% year-on-year to  111 crore. ebitdar margin dropped to 1.8% from a robust 29% in q2 2017-18 and 16% in the june 2018-19 quarter. ebitdar is a key measure of profitability for airlines.  given disappointing yields high crude prices and a depreciating indian rupee we cannot be constructive on indigo  said hdfc securities institutional equity research analysts in a note on the results.  further given this significant miss in earnings we will be revising our estimates downwards.  average brent crude oil prices so far this quarter are slightly higher compared to q2. in short the turbulence will continue for airlines including indigo. it will hardly be surprising if after indigo q2 results investors of spicejet ltd and jet airways (india) ltd mark down their expectations substantially.</div></div>
