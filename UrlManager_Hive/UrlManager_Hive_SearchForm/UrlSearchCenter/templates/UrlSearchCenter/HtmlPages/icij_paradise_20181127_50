<div><div><h2>How Nike Stays One Step Ahead of the Regulators</h2></div><div>when one tax loophole closes another opens. five days before christmas 2006 nike chief executive mark parker was in an upbeat mood on a conference call with wall street analysts. \xe2\x80\x9cso how are we doing \xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself out loud almost a year since his promotion to the job. \xe2\x80\x9cin a word i would say \xe2\x80\x98good.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he reeled off a list of recent achievements including a brief mention of \xe2\x80\x9ca more favorable long-term tax agreement in europe\xe2\x80\x9d according to a transcript of the call. this had he said \xe2\x80\x9csecured a big advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d an advantage over whom or what  how big  what did this favorable agreement entail  these were all questions the analysts did not ask. the mechanics of tax avoidance are rarely scrutinized on such calls despite the enormous earnings boost they can provide \xe2\x80\x93 and the damage they can do to national treasuries. behind the scenes authorities in the netherlands had effectively given nike the green light for a 10-year tax-avoidance arrangement that would allow the sportswear-maker to shift billions of dollars in profits from europe to the tax haven of bermuda. nike\xe2\x80\x99s tax burden hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the same since. in the three years after that conference call its after-tax profits would jump by an astounding 55 percent to $1.88 billion thanks in substantial part to a drop in its worldwide effective tax rate from 34.9 percent to 24.8 percent \xe2\x80\x93 on its way to 13.2 percent last year. nike\xe2\x80\x99s tax planning over the years exemplifies how adept multinationals can be at staying ahead of the game. by building cross-border structures of interconnected companies that trade with one another global businesses are often able to find ways of unlocking tax savings that no lawmaker intended them to receive. in many instances these structures have no purpose other than to push global profits into offshore tax havens or into companies that are for tax purposes based nowhere at all. vital to nike\xe2\x80\x99s new arrangement was a bermudan subsidiary nike international ltd. through it the sportswear-maker held ownership of its iconic swoosh design together with other prized trademarks for markets outside the united states. the bermudan subsidiary was able to charge trademark royalty fees to nike\xe2\x80\x99s european headquarters in the dutch town of hilversum which was selling sneakers and other sportswear to thousands of independent wholesalers and retailers as well as directly to customers through nike&#8217;s own stores across europe. the royalty fees shifted billions in profits away from europe where they would otherwise have been taxed and salted them away about 3680 miles across the sea in tax-free bermuda \xe2\x80\x93 where the leaked documents reveal nike has no staff or offices but merely a few documents on file at the bermudan corporate registry and at appleby a legal and corporate services firm. the icij s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and more than 90 other media partners have been analyzing about 6.8 million leaked documents the <a href="http://icij.org/investigations/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> from the internal files of offshore law firm appleby global and corporate services provider estera two businesses that operated together under the appleby name until estera became independent in 2016. together with other documents and test purchases made across europe the leaked files reveal how nike\xe2\x80\x99s tax-avoidance structure worked. internal appleby files show how much of nike international\xe2\x80\x99s affairs were run by senior executives lawyers and accountants at nike\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in beaverton oregon. a duplicate of nike international\xe2\x80\x99s official seal &#8211; a stamp used to execute documents in significant transactions &#8211; was kept in beaverton. nevertheless for tax purposes nike international remained firmly bermudan. for years enormous royalty payments to bermuda went unmentioned in the accounts of nike\xe2\x80\x99s dutch subsidiaries. the first clue as to the amount of money flowing offshore came last year when nike made limited disclosures in a largely unrelated case in u.s. tax court. court submissions included brief mention of royalty payments to bermuda in 2010 2011 and 2012. together they totaled $3.86 billion. the flow of trademark royalties had helped nike build a $6.6 billion pile of offshore profits by june 2014. this sum had been taxed at just 3 percent outside the united states. and because it remained offshore it had yielded no u.s. tax at all. presented with questions about this tax arrangement nike responded only with this statement: \xe2\x80\x9cnike fully complies with tax regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 the generous 10-year deal that nike received from dutch tax authorities was about to expire. but nike and its advisers including the u.s. law firm baker mckenzie came up with a solution. with only a few adjustments they realized trademark payments could continue to flow out of nike\xe2\x80\x99s european headquarters with little or no tax. after a reorganization of nike\xe2\x80\x99s tax-avoidance structure in 2014 its operations in hilversum made royalty payments of $982 million in 2015 and $1.13 billion in 2016 company accounts show. under the revised structure the swoosh and other trademarks had been transferred from the bermuda subsidiary to a new dutch subsidiary nike innovate cv. the initials \xe2\x80\x9ccv\xe2\x80\x9d appear repeatedly in the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">leaked appleby</a> and estera records offering a glimpse at one of the most secretive and effective components in tax-avoidance strategies. the netherlands\xe2\x80\x99 cv \xe2\x80\x93 which stands for \xe2\x80\x9ccommanditaire vennootschap\xe2\x80\x9d or limited partnership \xe2\x80\x93 is born out of legislation dating back to the 1830s. in recent times it has proved popular with multinationals because if set up carefully it can escape dutch taxes and taxes elsewhere too. in effect a cv that is owned by partners outside the netherlands can be entirely stateless and as a result taxless. many u.s. multinationals therefore set up non-dutch holding companies that agree to form dutch cvs. this is how it works: under the dutch law profits made through a cv are regarded as if they were made by the partners. as such these earnings have been made outside the netherlands and cannot be taxed there. other countries meanwhile see the picture differently. they see dutch cvs as much like regular companies and regard the taxing rights as belonging to the dutch. in tax-avoidance circles this confusion is much sought after and is known as a \xe2\x80\x9chybrid mismatch.\xe2\x80\x9d according to an analysis of u.s. balance-of-payments data by gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley almost one in six dollars of foreign profit made by american multinationals last year was made \xe2\x80\x93 on paper at least \xe2\x80\x93 through dutch subsidiaries. the icij reviewed stock market filings for america\xe2\x80\x99s 500 largest publicly traded multinationals using data available in june 2017 and found 214 subsidiaries that were formed as dutch cvs. nike currently has 11 cv subsidiaries. despite initial resistance from the netherlands the european union this year adopted a directive requiring member states to tighten their tax laws to combat the most aggressive avoidance structures \xe2\x80\x93 including those involving cvs \xe2\x80\x93 by 2022 at the latest. the dutch ministry of finance said it expected to publish draft legislation next year with a view to having the news rules become effective at the start of 2020. in late 2016 the ministry had urged other eu member states to delay reforms because of the heavy toll they were likely to take on the netherlands where the government estimates that 77660 jobs are linked to u.s. multinationals that have been drawn there by the possibility of developing tax structures using cvs. \xe2\x80\x9cthe loss of the advantages provided by this structure would make the netherlands less attractive to the american multinationals who use it\xe2\x80\x9d the ministry told the icij in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cwithout simultaneous changes in tax rates jobs may be lost as companies relocated their head office functions to alternative locations where they can set up a hybrid mismatch structure or to low-tax countries.\xe2\x80\x9d despite the likelihood of new legislation to curb the use of cvs in tax planning it has remained popular with u.s. multinationals. ride-hailing app provider uber has set up a dutch cv with the help of appleby as has data-storage group netapp. for 2014 and 2015 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4175250-netappnaservices-agreement.html">netapp\xe2\x80\x99s cv made royalty profits of $1.1 billion</a> on which it paid no tax. in the last two years tesla has asked appleby\xe2\x80\x99s office on the isle of man \xe2\x80\x93 a tax haven about 5100 miles from its headquarters in palo alto california \xe2\x80\x93 to take minutes at meetings for its new cv. asked whether these meetings were taking place in the isle of man whether tesla\xe2\x80\x99s cv held rights to any of the carmaker\xe2\x80\x99s valuable intangible property and where the cv filed tax returns tesla declined to comment specifically. instead a spokesperson said in a statement: \xe2\x80\x9cnot only are we fully compliant with the law but tesla has not realized any tax benefit from [its cv].\xe2\x80\x9d netapp declined to comment as did uber which has yet to realize a benefit from its tax structure as it spends profits on expansion. asked whether nike innovate cv files tax returns in any country or whether it is in fact stateless nike declined to comment. in a statement nike said &#8220;we rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with how we run our business the investments we make and the jobs we create.\xe2\x80\x9d since switching property rights to the swoosh and other trademarks from the bermuda subsidiary to the dutch partnership in 2014 nike\xe2\x80\x99s pile of offshore profits has continued to grow. at the end of may 2017 it had reached $12.2 billion. these accumulated earnings have been taxed at less than 2 percent by foreign tax authorities \xe2\x80\x93 and not at all in the united states. meanwhile parker the nike ceo has also continued to prosper. for the last six years he received compensation worth a total of nearly $144 million in part for increasing profits and keeping taxes down. the chair of the compensation committee that sets parker\xe2\x80\x99s pay is apple chief executive tim cook whose company has been similarly aggressive in reducing taxes. on his conference call to wall street at the end of september 2017 parker once again sounded optimistic. \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re very bullish on what\xe2\x80\x99s coming down the pipeline\xe2\x80\x9d he said. and once again wall street analysts were told that nike had revised downward its forecast for the multinational\xe2\x80\x99s effective tax rate. three months earlier nike had predicted finishing its financial year in may 2018 with a rate between 16 and 18 percent. since then executives explained expectations had altered. the new likely range was 15 to 17 percent.  contributors to this story: <a href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/helena-bengtsson/">helena bengtsson</a> </div></div>
