<div><div><h2>&#8216;Africa&#8217;s Satellite&#8217; Avoided Millions Using A Very African Tax Scheme</h2></div><div>the companies behind the new dawn satellite channeled millions of dollars through offshore companies in mauritius one of the continent\xe2\x80\x99s premier tax havens. at 5:37 p.m. on april 22 2011 from a seaside launch pad in latin america a hulking satellite rose into the sky and came to rest over the 33rd meridian east above northern tanzania. the new dawn satellite was proudly african \xe2\x80\x93 partly funded by local investors and promoted as a way for african schoolchildren nurses civil servants and businesses to access world-class internet and mobile phone networks. but if its purpose was to promote african development its tax strategy did exactly the opposite. the companies behind the new dawn satellite channeled millions of dollars in payments from african companies and governments through offshore companies in mauritius one of the <a href="/investigations/paradise-papers/tax-haven-mauritius-africa/">continent\xe2\x80\x99s premier tax havens</a>. in so doing the companies achieved a mauritian double-whammy using one kind of offshore company to avoid local taxes and another to pay as little as possible on bills paid from overseas using treaties signed between mauritius and its african neighbors. the primary money-making company estimated that it would pay $22500 in taxes on $75 million in revenue \xe2\x80\x93 just 0.03 percent. in a 17-year lifespan the company predicted it would earn $936 million yet never pay taxes above $300000. <script src="//assets.documentcloud.org/viewer/loader.js"></script><br /><script>  dv.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4382110-new-dawn-africa-s-satellite-powerpoint.js" {

according to a powerpoint presentation from the paradise papers offshore documents that include nearly seven million files from the law firm appleby and its clients including the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s co-owner intelsat. \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of the tax structure is to drastically minimize the tax exposure of the company and pay as little as possible which the company has successfully achieved\xe2\x80\x9d said alexander ezenagu an international tax researcher with international centre for tax and development who analyzed intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s documents. the mauritius arrangement lasted until 2013 when intelsat closed the companies down after unexpectedly low financial returns. the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4382111-new-dawn-mauritius-2013-tax-return.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company\xe2\x80\x99s tax return that year</a> reflects that it paid 0.09 percent tax on $31.6 million. intelsat told the international consortium of investigative journalists that it \xe2\x80\x9chas a proud history of serving the african continent providing vital connectivity and access to world-class technology since the late 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d it said mauritius was chosen \xe2\x80\x9cin concert\xe2\x80\x9d with its south african investment partners. \xe2\x80\x9cwe pay taxes where we have established a taxable presence such as our regional office in south africa\xe2\x80\x9d intelsat said. \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we do not have a taxable presence in nations where applicable our services are taxed through withholding taxes which are paid on our behalf by our customers under our contractual agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d according to other tax experts though those payments are unlikely to be made. the new dawn project was terminated in 2013 \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing a major satellite anomaly that irreparably reduced the commercial viability and financial returns expected from the project\xe2\x80\x9d intelsat said. though not a household name luxembourg-based intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s technologies are behind some of the 20th century\xe2\x80\x99s most enduring memories. intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s satellites for example allowed millions to watch the 1969 moon landing and the 2000 sydney olympics. its satellites cover 99 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population allowing cell phone and internet providers to offer phone calls online surfing and television. in 2008 intelsat announced plans to launch the new dawn satellite its first with an african focus. the satellite built in virginia used channels or \xe2\x80\x9ctransponders\xe2\x80\x9d that helped send information via antennas to earth. for years governments and the private sector have salivated at prospects for africa\xe2\x80\x99s development \xe2\x80\x93 if only there were improvements to the continent\xe2\x80\x99s communication black holes. intelsat used the appleby law firm and accounting firm kpmg to establish the mauritius companies behind the new dawn satellite. <iframe style="height: 70vh; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"

south africa\xe2\x80\x99s convergence a consortium of largely african investors were initial investors. (convergence left the partnership after one year.) following the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 launch and the first customer orders the african tax haven strategy proved lucrative according to dozens of invoices tax returns and financial statements from <a href="/paradisepapers">the paradise papers</a>. nearly all new dawn\xe2\x80\x99s income came from cell phone and satellite companies including airtel one of africa\xe2\x80\x99s major providers. namibia\xe2\x80\x99s government-owned telecommunications company telecom namibia \xc2\xa0and south africa\xe2\x80\x99s state-owned signal distributor sentech were also customers. airtel\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries paid intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius-based company new dawn distribution company ltd. for services in that included sierra leone the republic of congo chad gabon madagascar niger and the democratic republic of the congo \xe2\x80\x93 then the poorest country in the world. some contracts brought in $100000 a month. in 2012 for example intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s mauritius company sent a bill to airtel in the republic of congo for $201000. under a 2011 treaty the republic of congo agreed to waive taxes on its domestic companies worth up to 20 percent on the value of services provided by companies in mauritius such as intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s. in this one invoice alone then the republic of congo could have forgone up to $40000 in taxes on the $201000 bill paid from the client to intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s mauritian shell company. intelsat did not respond to icij\xe2\x80\x99s specific questions about whether or not it its customers paid reduced or no taxes under treaties. it told icij that in general \xe2\x80\x9cwe pay withholding taxes where required through contractual terms with our customers in the countries where the services are being consumed.\xe2\x80\x9d airtel declined to comment. \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the problem\xe2\x80\x9d said alvin mosioma executive director of tax justice network &#8211; africa who described telecommunications companies as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the major culprits on the continent when it comes to aggressive tax avoidance.\xe2\x80\x9d using treaties in this way mosioma said \xe2\x80\x9cshifts the responsibility to the telecommunications companies.\xe2\x80\x9d the end result mosioma said is that some taxes might not be paid at all. treaties such as the one signed between the republic of congo and mauritius could have allowed intelsat to avoid or reduce tax in mauritius and could have scrapped some taxes entirely in the republic of congo that would without a treaty be paid by intelsat\xe2\x80\x99s customer. financial and company laws in mauritius researcher ezenagu says \xe2\x80\x9care structured to provide tax advantage to companies at the detriment of countries where the real economic activities occur and value is created.\xe2\x80\x9d intesalt\xe2\x80\x99s structure \xe2\x80\x9ctakes advantage\xe2\x80\x9d of these laws ezenagu said. \xe2\x80\x9ci would honestly think by now that tax treaties with mauritius should have become discredited\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cthey simply do not grant the benefits to the countries that they were told they would.\xe2\x80\x9d</div></div>
