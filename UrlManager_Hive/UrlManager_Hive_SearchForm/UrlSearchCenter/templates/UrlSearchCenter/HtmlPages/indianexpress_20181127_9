<div><div><h2>For downgrade: Moody’s puts Bharti Airtel rating on review</h2></div><div>moody’s investors service on thursday said that it has placed on review for downgrade the baa3 issuer and senior unsecured rating of bharti airtel and the ratings on the backed senior unsecured notes issued by bharti’s wholly-owned subsidiary bharti airtel international (netherlands) bv. the ratings agency said in a statement that the review will focus on the company’s commitments and plans to substantially reduce debt levels significantly over a short period of time; and plans to turn around the underlying indian mobile operations. the ratings could be downgraded if the company fails to use proceeds received from its recent pre-ipo of its african business or its proposed capital-raising activities for debt reduction it said. any further deterioration in bharti’s operating performance particularly in the indian mobile segment such that earnings and cash flows or revenue market share contracts from current levels would also lead to a downgrade moody’s added. “the review for downgrade is primarily driven by our expectation that bharti’s cash flow generation will remain weak and leverage elevated” annalisa dichiara a moody’s vice-president and senior credit officer said. the moody’s statement said that the review also reflects the company’s low levels of profitability particularly from its core indian mobile operations negative free cash flow and higher debt levels to fund capital spending. “because we believe a more rational competitive environment in india’s telecommunications market is unlikely over the next 12-18 months the review also reflects uncertainty as to whether the company’s profitability cash flow situation and debt levels can improve sustainably and materially over the same period” dichiara who’s also moody’s lead analyst for bharti said. as on september 30 2018 bharti’s consolidated adjusted debt/ebitda was around 4.5 times. while moody’s expects that the majority of the $1.25 billion raised from the pre-ipo of its african business will be used to reduce debt leverage will only improve marginally. —</div></div>
