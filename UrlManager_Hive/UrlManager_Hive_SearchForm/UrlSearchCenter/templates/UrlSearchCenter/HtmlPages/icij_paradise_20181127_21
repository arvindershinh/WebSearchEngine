<div><div><h2>The End Of Elusion For PokerStars</h2></div><div>an online gambling firm used the offshore world to cater to u.s. players until a justice department crackdown. in early 2010 the multibillion-dollar online gambling firm <a href="https://www.pokerstars.com/">pokerstars</a> was riding a spectacular winning streak. on busy days close to 50000 players flocked to its virtual card tables \xe2\x80\x93 about five times the number four years earlier and almost double the action at its nearest rival. but behind the scenes trouble was brewing. a leaked email from <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/appleby-offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-of-compliance-failures-icij/">offshore law firm appleby</a> reveals that lawyers in its isle of man office believed that the u.s. justice department could take action against pokerstars at any moment. at pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 request the law firm began researching offshore jurisdictions to determine which would be most likely to protect the business from u.s. seizure orders. in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4320928-appleby-email-pokerstars.html">group email to five appleby partners</a> in other remote havens a senior lawyer in the isle of man office asked: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would be your courts\xe2\x80\x99 likely view on a potential injunction made by the u.s. authorities [ ]\xe2\x80\x9d pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 dominance of online poker was built on a high-risk decision to continue catering to players in the united states \xe2\x80\x93 by far the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest poker market \xe2\x80\x93 despite legislation enacted in 2006 creating a new federal offense \xe2\x80\x9cprohibiting gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments\xe2\x80\x9d for an unlawful internet wager. many of pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 competitors closed their sites to u.s. players because of the legislation. that left the field open for pokerstarsand its founder isai scheinberg an israeli-canadian mathematician. pokerstars informed its users that it had received \xe2\x80\x9cextensive expert advice\xe2\x80\x9d that the company could continue to offer online poker. lawyers the firm turned to took the view that \xe2\x80\x93 unlike other forms of gambling \xe2\x80\x93 poker was not within the scope of the legislation. the justice department openly disagreed. in any event because pokerstars was run from the isle of man \xe2\x80\x93 a gambling-friendly tax haven midway between great britain and ireland \xe2\x80\x93 there was for several years little u.s. authorities could do to stop the thriving site from doing business with american players. by 2010 that was changing. the justice department had spent years hunting down and prosecuting those involved in processing u.s. payments for pokerstars and other offshore websites. eight months before the appleby email the prosecutors had frozen bank accounts containing at least $30 million in winnings owed to 27000 u.s. players many of them pokerstars customers. the justice department claimed that the accounts were controlled by a payment processor who had lied to or misled u.s. banks. as nick verardi who led appleby\xe2\x80\x99s isle of man corporate law practice explained in an internal appleby email in february 2010 seizure actions could soon spread outside the united states. \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he doj may at its own discretion attempt to take steps to seize any monies relating to online gambling conducted in the u.s\xe2\x80\x9d he said. this would be a blow to appleby too. pokerstars was one of its largest clients and had become a major player in the economy of the isle of man where online gambling\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to national income had more than doubled in two years generating 9.1 percent of the total in 2010. reaching out to senior partners at appleby offices in hong kong the british virgin islands cayman islands bermuda and mauritius verardi wanted to know if they could provide advice that would help him identify the haven best able to shield pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 gambling money from potential action by the justice department. expanding on his query about how courts in other jurisdictions might react if the justice department secured an injunction verardi asked his colleagues: \xe2\x80\x9cis international comity high on your jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s agenda at the moment \xe2\x80\x9d comity is the principle that different jurisdictions will respect one another\xe2\x80\x99s legal decisions. the appleby lawyer explained that pokerstars was pooling players\xe2\x80\x99 money reserved for payment of any winnings in a single fund held in the isle of man. \xe2\x80\x9cas you can imagine the total amount runs [into] many millions of dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d in the end no plan was developed to transfer money to other parts of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s offshore network. in early 2011 the law firm did set up companies in the isle of man that pokerstars intended to use to segregate u.s. players\xe2\x80\x99 funds. but the effort was cut short before the money moved. in april 2011 the justice department intervened decisively freezing funds around the world and forcing pokerstars out of the u.s. market. key payment middlemen and top online poker industry executives \xe2\x80\x93 including pokerstars founder scheinberg \xe2\x80\x93 were charged with illegal gambling offenses money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. at the same time in what became known in online poker circles as \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.pokernews.com/news/2016/04/black-friday-five-years-later-24506.htm">black friday</a>\xe2\x80\x9d pokerstars.com and other leading sites shut down their web pages displaying government seizure notices. around the world 75 bank accounts associated with the gambling firms were frozen including swiss accounts linked to pokerstars companies. the justice department wanted pokerstars to forfeit $1.5 billion. its founder faced charges that could send him to prison for up to 65 years. the indictment set out details of an audacious conspiracy. according to u.s. prosecutors scheinberg and pokerstars managers engaged a handful of partners to process u.s. gambling money for use on pokerstars.com using false transaction codes and other means to deceive banks. prosecutors alleged that gambling money was fraudulently wired from fronts including \xe2\x80\x9cnon-existent online merchants purporting to sell\xe2\x80\x9d goods ranging from golf balls to pet food to jewelry. some payment processors were also said to have disguised pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 dealings with u.s. players as payday loan transactions. u.s. banks were allegedly involved too. according to the justice department payment processors used by pokerstars targeted small banks on the brink of collapse promising large investments in exchange for illegally processing gambling money . despite these serious allegations appleby continued its business relationship with pokerstars scheinberg and scheinberg\xe2\x80\x99s son mark in whose name the business was owned. all have denied wrongdoing. a little more than a year after black friday pokerstars paid $547 million to settle the justice department\xe2\x80\x99s civil claims  without admitting wrongdoing or liability. as part of the deal it promised to never again take u.s. poker players\xe2\x80\x99 money and to ensure that isai scheinberg \xe2\x80\x93 a fugitive from justice \xe2\x80\x93 was no longer directly involved in running the business. two years later in 2014 pokerstars was sold to another gaming corporation and mark scheinberg received $3.7 billion for his stake \xe2\x80\x93 more than 70 times the $50 million that he had paid as part of a separate settlement which also included no admission of wrongdoing. of the 11 men \xe2\x80\x93 including pokerstars employees and payment processors \xe2\x80\x93 indicted in 2011 10 pleaded guilty to at least one of the offenses with which they were charged. the exception was isai scheinberg who remains at large. contacted by the icij appleby declined to respond on the record to specific questions in part the law firm said because it did not want to breach the duty of confidentiality owed to pokerstars and the scheinbergs. although a hero to many u.s. poker players isai scheinberg has always shunned media attention and not much is known about him. the former ibm employee was born in eretz israel (the land of israel) before independence and he grew up in lithuania. he received a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in mathematics from moscow state university and served in the israeli defenses forces before settling in canada where he turned his love of poker into the world\xe2\x80\x99s most successful online card room. scheinberg told the icij that there had never been a conspiracy \xe2\x80\x9cto hide or conceal any of pokerstars\xe2\x80\x99 activity\xe2\x80\x9d. he also said the website had never been involved in lying to banks and that he and his son denied any allegations of impropriety or wrongdoing. \xe2\x80\x9cpokerstars has always acted in a legal and transparent manner including in connection with its dealing with financial institutions\xe2\x80\x9d scheinberg said. for the last six years scheinberg has lived in a secluded multimillion-dollar mansion on the isle of man from which the u.s. justice department has been unable to extradite him. he can often be seen walking his dog. appleby files identify mark scheinberg \xe2\x80\x93 reportedly the isle of man\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest resident \xe2\x80\x93 as the owner of his father\xe2\x80\x99s home.</div></div>
