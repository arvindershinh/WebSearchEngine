<div><div><h2>Passports, arms dealers and frozen accounts: What our partners found in the new Panama Papers data</h2></div><div>icij partners from latin america to eastern europe (and in between) have exposed a plethora of new abuses. a <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/new-panama-papers-leak-reveals-mossack-fonsecas-chaotic-scramble/">fresh leak of 1.2 million documents</a> from the law firm at the center of the panama papers has unveiled secrets about how some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest powerful and most famous people made \xe2\x80\x94 and concealed \xe2\x80\x94 their money. in some cases the new passports bank statements emails and other documents upend previous defenses and explanations by politicians and superstars when confronted with the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">panama papers</a> findings. here are a few of the latest stories from the international consortium of investigative journalists\xe2\x80\x99 global media partners: icij\xe2\x80\x99s partner <a href="https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2018/06/21/nota/6821228/fiscalia-suiza-congelo-cuentas-exgerente-petroecuador">el universo reported</a> that switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s federal prosecutor had frozen accounts belonging to the former manager of petroecuador as part of a bribery investigation into a dozen companies created by the panama law firm mossack fonseca. according to documents from the latest panama papers leak swiss bank syz notified mossack fonseca in september 2016 that the prosecutor had ordered a freeze on assets held by the state oil company\xe2\x80\x99s former manager alex bravo panchano or his company johanna investment corp. the action came months after the initial publication of icij\xe2\x80\x99s panama papers investigation. as part of that investigation el universo had reported that <a href="https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2016/05/07/nota/5565117/alex-bravo-tiene-vinculos-cuatro-firmas-papel-creadas-panama">four offshore companies</a> in panama were tied to the former petroecuador manager. one of them girbra s.a. had signed an agreement with a petroecuador contractor. laying out the grounds for his investigation swiss prosecutor frederic schaller said that bravo is suspected of providing at least $35 million in benefits to his associates in the process of awarding of 142 petroecuador contracts according to el universo. the new panama papers documents contain a headache for the mayor of major <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/panama-papers-yield-smoking-gun-on-odesa-mayors-russian-passport">ukrainian port town odessa</a>. mayor gennadiy trukhanov denied reports when the panama papers investigation first broke in april 2016 that he held a russian passport. holding second citizenship is illegal in ukraine and connections to russia are particularly fraught following years of russian interference reported icij partner occrp. trukhanov was connected to offshore companies used in the construction business according to the original panama papers reporting. in those files trukhanov was listed as having a residential address in northeastern russia raising suspicions of a russian connection. trukhanov denied russian citizenship. ukrainian and russian officials leaped to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s defense. the new files show the opposite: a russian passport bearing trukhanov\xe2\x80\x99s name and personal information. trukhanov who is also under investigation in ukraine for <a href="https://en.hromadske.ua/posts/clashes-outside-hearing-of-arrested-odesa-mayor src=ilaw">embezzling state funds</a> during the purchase of a factory did not respond to occrp\xe2\x80\x99s request for comment. in peru <a href="http://convoca.pe/panamapapers/">convoca</a> made a startling discovery with the newly-leaked documents: although mossack fonseca had set up offshore company gss group ltd in 1993 the law firm only learned in september 2016 that the company\xe2\x80\x99s owner is <a href="https://larepublica.pe/politica/291301-rothschild-de-piloto-a-traficante">fugitive arms dealer moshe rothschild</a>. the company was used for dredging and other maritime activities according to the panama papers. in the 1990s rothschild allegedly tried to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-sending-back-judge-peru-wants-israel-to-extradite-arms-dealer/">bribe peruvian officials</a> to buy used soviet fighter planes. peru has indicted the former israeli air force pilot on five corruption charges according to convoca. rothschild has eluded peru\xe2\x80\x99s legal requests to return to peru to face corruption bribery and other charges. the new panama papers documents reveal that a senior representative of a chinese pharmaceutical company menovo may have misused the passport of a european medicines inspector to set up <a href="https://www.ostro.si/en/stories/mossack-fonseca-facilitated-identity-theft-of-government-inspector">offshore companies in the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s name</a> according to news organization o\xc5\xa1tro. the slovenian inspector of a government agency who inspected a factory for the major european medicines producer krka denied wrongdoing in 2016. he filed a criminal complaint for identity theft and was dismissed by his employer. the passport copy used to set up the offshore companies seems to bear a different signature from the inspector\xe2\x80\x99s real passport reported o\xc5\xa1tro. mossack fonseca employees performed an internal check and confirmed the irregularity after receiving questions from slovenian reporters in 2016. \xe2\x80\x9csignatures&#8230;are not the same\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed a mossack fonseca employee in march 2016 after receiving questions from journalists. a chinese intermediary who is the chairman of the chinese pharmaceutical company that supplies krka shared with mossack fonseca the disputed passport copy used to open offshore companies o\xc5\xa1tro said. the company and its executive denied wrongdoing and blamed mossack fonseca for \xe2\x80\x9cpoor management.\xe2\x80\x9d the chinese factory produces materials used in krka\xe2\x80\x99s medical products sold in the european union. the new panama papers documents reveal further details about how one of <a
