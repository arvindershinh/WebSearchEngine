<div><div><h2>Offshore Trove Exposes Trump-Russia links and Piggy Banks of the Wealthiest 1 Percent</h2></div><div>a new leak of confidential records reveals the financial hideaways of iconic brands and power brokers across the political spectrum.  a trove of 13.4 million records exposes ties between russia and u.s. president donald trump\xe2\x80\x99s billionaire commerce secretary the secret dealings of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/justin-trudeau-chief-fundraiser-stephen-bronfman-linked-to-offshore-tax-maneuvers-icij/">chief fundraiser for canadian prime minister justin trudeau</a>\xc2\xa0and the offshore interests of the queen of england and more than 120 politicians around the world. the leaked documents dubbed the <a href="http://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers">paradise papers</a> show how deeply the offshore financial system is entangled with the overlapping worlds of political players private wealth and corporate giants including apple nike uber and other global companies that avoid taxes through increasingly imaginative bookkeeping maneuvers. one offshore web leads to trump\xe2\x80\x99s commerce secretary private equity tycoon <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/donald-trumps-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-and-his-russian-business-ties/">wilbur ross who has a stake in a shipping company</a> that has received more than $68 million in revenue since 2014 from a russian energy company co-owned by the son-in-law of russian president vladimir putin. in all the offshore ties of more than a <a href="https://projects.icij.org/paradise-papers/the-influencers/#/">dozen trump advisers cabinet members and major donors</a> appear in the leaked data. the new files come from two offshore services firms as well as from 19 corporate registries maintained by governments in jurisdictions that serve as waystations in the global shadow economy. the leaks were obtained by german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries. the promise of tax havens is secrecy \xe2\x80\x93 offshore locales create and oversee companies that often are difficult or impossible to trace back to their owners. while having an offshore entity is often legal the built-in secrecy attracts money launderers drug traffickers kleptocrats and others who want to operate in the shadows. offshore companies often \xe2\x80\x9cshells\xe2\x80\x9d with no employees or office space are also used in complex tax-avoidance structures that drain billions from national treasuries. the offshore industry makes \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor poorer\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cdeepening wealth inequality\xe2\x80\x9d said brooke harrington a certified wealth manager and copenhagen business school professor who is the author of &#8216;capital without borders: wealth managers and the one percent.&#8217; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is this small group of people who are not equally subject to the laws as the rest of us and that\xe2\x80\x99s on purpose\xe2\x80\x9d harrington said. these people \xe2\x80\x9clive the dream\xe2\x80\x9d of enjoying \xe2\x80\x9cthe benefits of society without being subject to any of its constraints.\xe2\x80\x9d the records expand on the revelations from the leak of offshore documents that spawned the <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org">2016 panama papers</a> investigation by icij and its media partners. the new files shine a light on a different cast of underexplored island havens including some with cleaner reputations and higher price tags such as the cayman islands and bermuda. the most detailed revelations emerge in decades of corporate records from the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">white-shoe offshore law firm appleby</a> and corporate services provider estera two businesses that operated together under the appleby name until estera became independent in 2016. at least 31000 of the individual and corporate clients included in appleby\xe2\x80\x99s records are u.s. citizens or have u.s. addresses more than from any other country. appleby also counted clients from the united kingdom china and canada among its biggest sources of business. nearly 7 million records from appleby and affiliates cover the period from 1950 to 2016 and include emails billion-dollar loan agreements and bank statements involving at least 25000 entities connected to people in 180 countries. appleby is a member of the \xe2\x80\x9coffshore magic circle\xe2\x80\x9d an informal clique of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s leading offshore law practices. the firm was founded bermuda and has offices in hong kong shanghai the british virgin islands the cayman islands and other offshore centers. appleby has a well-guarded 100-year reputation and has avoided public scrapes through a mixture of discretion and expensive client monitoring. in contrast to appleby\xe2\x80\x99s public image the files reveal a company that has provided services to risky clients from iran russia and libya failed government audits that identified gaps in anti-money-laundering procedures and been fined in secret by the bermuda financial regulator. appleby did not reply to icij\xe2\x80\x99s detailed questions but released an online statement saying it had investigated icij\xe2\x80\x99s questions and is \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d the firm said it is \xe2\x80\x9csubject to frequent regulatory checks and we are committed to achieving the high standards set by our regulators.\xe2\x80\x9d the leaked cache of documents includes more than half a million files from asiaciti trust a family-run offshore specialist that is headquartered in singapore and has satellite offices from samoa in the south pacific to nevis in the caribbean. the leaked files also include documents from government business registries in some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most secretive corporate havens in the caribbean the pacific and europe such as antigua and barbuda the cook islands and malta. one-fifth of the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest secrecy jurisdictions are represented in these databases. taken as a whole the leaks reveal offshore traces of spy planes purchased by the united arab emirates the barbados explosives company of a canadian engineer who tried to build a \xe2\x80\x9csuper gun\xe2\x80\x9d for iraqi dictator saddam hussein and the bermuda company of the late marcial maciel degollado the influential mexican priest who founded the catholic religious order the legionaries of christ and whose legacy was marred by allegations of child sexual abuse. queen elizabeth ii has invested millions of dollars in medical and consumer loan companies appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files show. while the queen\xe2\x80\x99s private estate the duchy of lancaster provides some details of its investments in u.k. property such as commercial buildings scattered across southern england it has never disclosed details of its offshore investments. &#8220;yes the duchy was aware that the jubilee absolute return fund was run offshore&#8221; said chris addock chief finance officer of the duchy of lancaster. the records show that as of 2007 the queen\xe2\x80\x99s private estate invested in a cayman islands fund that in turn invested in a private equity company that controlled brighthouse a u.k. rent-to-own firm criticized by consumer watchdogs and members of parliament for selling household goods to cash-strapped britons on payment plans with interest rates as high as 99.9 percent. other royals and politicians with newly disclosed offshore ties include queen noor of jordan who was listed as the beneficiary of two trusts on the island of jersey including one that held her sprawling british estate; sam kutesa uganda\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister and a former u.n. general assembly president who set up an offshore trust in the seychelles to manage his personal wealth; brazil\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister henrique de campos meirelles who created a foundation in bermuda \xe2\x80\x9cfor charitable purposes\xe2\x80\x9d; and antanas guoga a lithuanian member of the european parliament and professional poker player who held a stake in an isle of man company whose other shareholders included a gambling mogul who settled a fraud lawsuit in the united states. wesley clark a one-time democratic presidential hopeful and a retired four-star u.s. army general who served as nato\xe2\x80\x99s supreme commander in europe  was a director of an online gambling company with offshore subsidiaries the files show. a spokesman for queen elizabeth ii told icij partner the guardian that the duchy has an ongoing investment in the cayman island fund and was not aware of the investment in brighthouse. the queen voluntarily pays tax on income from the duchy and its investments the spokesman said. queen noor told icij that \xe2\x80\x9call the bequests made to her and to her children by [the late king hussein] have always been administered according to the highest ethical legal and regulatory standards.\xe2\x80\x9d brazil\xe2\x80\x99s meirelles said the foundation he created does not benefit him personally and will support education charities after his death. guoga said he declared his investment in the isle of man company to authorities and sold the last of his shares in 2014. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;i thought you could avoid not evade taxes but i found it was not practical\xe2\x80\x9d kutesa told icij\xe2\x80\x99s media partner the daily monitor. he said he did nothing with the company. \xe2\x80\x9c i told appleby to close it many years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">clark did not reply to requests for comment.</span> <span

\xe2\x80\x9cpassive minority investor\xe2\x80\x9d in the malta company that closed down in 2015 a spokeswoman said. wealthy people across the political spectrum use the offshore system. the files reveal that stephen bronfman canadian prime minister trudeau\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and close friend teamed up with liberal party stalwart leo kolber and kolber\xe2\x80\x99s son to quietly move millions of dollars to a cayman trust. the offshore maneuvers may have avoided taxes in canada the united states and israel according to experts who reviewed some of the 3000-plus files detailing the trust\xe2\x80\x99s activities. <iframe src="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/stories/paradise-papers e=1" width="100%" height="750" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> as the offshore riches grew lawyers for bronfman the kolbers and other wealthy interests lobbied canada\xe2\x80\x99s parliament to fight legislative proposals to tax income from offshore trusts. bronfman remains a key fundraiser for trudeau who has championed openness in government and promised a crackdown on offshore tax dodging. in september trudeau told the u.n. general assembly: \xe2\x80\x9cright now we have a system that encourages wealthy canadians to use private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than middle-class canadians. that\xe2\x80\x99s not fair and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fix it.\xe2\x80\x9d kolber\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers said in a letter to icij\xe2\x80\x99s partner cbc that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the transactions or entities at issue were effected or established to evade or even avoid taxation.\xe2\x80\x9d they added that the trusts \xe2\x80\x9cwere always in full conformity with all applicable laws and requirements\xe2\x80\x9d and said that no further comment would be provided by stephen bronfman.\xc2\xa0trudeau\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment. in the united states the files reveal <span style="font-weight: 400;">personal or corporate offshore ties</span>\xc2\xa0of key trump associates who are charged with helping to put \xe2\x80\x9camerica first.\xe2\x80\x9d the appleby files show how ross trump\xe2\x80\x99s commerce secretary has used a chain of cayman islands entities to maintain a financial stake in navigator holdings a shipping company whose top clients include the kremlin-linked energy firm sibur. among sibur\xe2\x80\x99s key owners are kirill shamalov putin\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law and gennady timchenko a billionaire the u.s. government sanctioned in 2014 because of his links to putin. sibur is a major customer of navigator paying the company more than $23 million in 2016. when he joined trump\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet ross divested his interests in 80 companies. but he kept stakes in nine companies including the four that connect him to navigator and its russian clients. these revelations come against a backdrop of growing concerns about hidden russian involvement in u.s. political affairs. sibur is \xe2\x80\x9ca company with crony connections\xe2\x80\x9d said daniel fried a russia expert who has served in senior state department posts in republican and democratic administrations. \xe2\x80\x9cwhy would any officer of the u.s. government have any relationship with a putin crony \xe2\x80\x9d a spokesman for ross said that the commerce secretary never met putin\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law or sibur\xe2\x80\x99s other owners and that he was not on the board of navigator when it initiated its relationship with sibur. ross recuses himself from matters that relate to international shipping his spokesman said and \xe2\x80\x9chas been generally supportive of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d against russian entities. the leaked files also led to other discoveries about u.s.-russian business ties. a document in the new cache of records helped steer icij and its media partners to public documents and panama papers files that illuminate links between a pair of kremlin-owned financial firms and major investments in twitter and facebook. in 2011 the investment fund run by tech mogul <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/">yuri milner received $191 million</a> from one of the russian government firms vtb bank and quietly invested that money in twitter. documents also show that a financial subsidiary of the kremlin-controlled energy giant gazprom funded a shell company that invested in a milner-affiliated company that held roughly $1 billion in facebook shares shortly before the social network\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 initial public offering. more recently milner invested $850000 in cadre a real estate firm co-founded by trump\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law and white house adviser jared kushner. milner is a russian citizen who lives in silicon valley. his ties to twitter facebook and kushner\xe2\x80\x99s firm have been previously disclosed. but his links to the kremlin financial institutions weren\xe2\x80\x99t known. vtb confirmed that it had used milner\xe2\x80\x99s fund to make an investment in twitter. facebook and twitter said they had properly reviewed milner\xe2\x80\x99s investments. in an interview milner said he was unaware of any possible involvement by the gazprom subsidiary in any of his deals and that none of his many investments have been related to politics. he said he used his own money in the kushner investment. on the other side of the u.s. political divide ross\xe2\x80\x99 predecessor as secretary of commerce penny pritzker pledged to sell investments to avoid conflicts of interest after she assumed her post in democratic president barack obama\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet. the files show that soon after she received senate confirmation in june 2013 pritzker transferred her interests in two bermuda companies to a firm that used the same mailing address as her private investment firm in chicago. the company was \xe2\x80\x9cowned by trusts that are for the benefit of penny pritzker&#8217;s children\xe2\x80\x9d according to appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files. these transfers may have fallen short of federal ethics standards for divestment according to ethics expert lawrence noble. republican and democratic donors alike appear in offshore records including randal quarles a gop-leaning donor and the new wall street watchdog at the federal reserve. quarles was an officer of two cayman island companies including one that was involved in a loan deal with a bermudan bank n.t. butterfield &  son. until recently quarles held an indirect interest in the bank which is under investigation by u.s. authorities for possible tax evasion by its american account holders. private equity funds controlled by democratic mega-donor george soros a hedge fund billionaire use appleby to help manage a web of offshore entities including an investment in one company engaged in reinsurance or insurance for insurers. his charitable organization the open society foundations is a donor to icij. a spokesperson at the federal reserve said quarles divested his indirect interest in the bermudan bank after he was confirmed for the government post. soros declined to comment. pritzker did not respond to requests for comment. when appleby is not serving the interests of some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest individuals it provides nuts-and-bolts legal help to corporations that seek to reduce their taxes in the countries where they do business. appleby is not a tax adviser but the firm plays a role in tax programs used by companies across the world. in addition to top-flight international banks such as barclays goldman sachs and bnp paribas other elite appleby clients have included the founder of one of the middle east\xe2\x80\x99s largest construction conglomerates the saad group and the japanese company operating the crippled nuclear power plant in fukushima. the files reveal that america\xe2\x80\x99s most profitable company apple inc. shopped around europe and the caribbean for a new island tax shelter after a u.s. senate inquiry found that the tech giant had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by shifting profits into irish subsidiaries. in one email exchange apple\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers asked appleby to confirm that a possible move to one of six offshore tax havens would allow an irish subsidiary to \xe2\x80\x9cconduct management activities . . . without being subject to taxation in these jurisdictions.\xe2\x80\x9d apple declined to comment on details of the corporate reorganization but told icij that it explained the new arrangements to government authorities and that the changes did not reduce its tax payments. the files also reveal how big corporations cut their taxes by creating offshore shell companies to hold intangible assets such as the design of nike\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cswoosh\xe2\x80\x9d logo and the creative rights to silicone breast implants. one of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s top corporate clients was glencore plc the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest commodity trader. the files contain decades of deals emails and multimillion-dollar loans to bankroll ventures in russia latin america africa and australia. <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/glencore-responds-icijs-questions">glencore was such an important client </a>that it once had its own room within appleby\xe2\x80\x99s offices in bermuda. company board meeting minutes document how glencore representatives leaned on daniel gertler an israeli businessman with high-level friends in the democratic republic of the congo to help seal a deal for a valuable copper mine. glencore lent millions to a company widely believed to belong to gertler described in a u.s. department of justice inquiry as a conduit for bribes. gertler and glencore were not named in the case. glencore said its background checks on gertler were \xe2\x80\x9cextensive and thorough.\xe2\x80\x9d the justice department investigation \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not constitute evidence of anything against mr. gertler\xe2\x80\x9d his lawyers said adding that he \xe2\x80\x9crejects absolutely any allegations of wrongdoing or criminality by him.\xe2\x80\x9d no loans were used improperly or for inappropriate purposes gertler&#8217;s lawyers said. the offshore industry is a globe-circling labyrinth of accountants bankers money managers lawyers and middlemen who get paid to serve the interests of the rich and well-connected. appleby for example is one link in a chain of offshore actors who helped sports stars russian oligarchs and government officials to purchase jets yachts and other luxury items. the offshore experts helped arkady and boris rotenberg two russian billionaires and childhood friends of president putin buy jets worth more than $20 million in 2013. u.s authorities blacklisted the rotenbergs in 2014 for their support of \xe2\x80\x9cputin\xe2\x80\x99s pet projects\xe2\x80\x9d and for having banked \xe2\x80\x9chigh price contracts\xe2\x80\x9d through the russian government. appleby cut its ties with the brothers but in one case received approval from the isle of man government nearly two years after sanctions were imposed to disburse fees to keep one of the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 companies on the business register. the rotenbergs did not reply to s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung\xe2\x80\x99s requests for comment. clients prize appleby for its expertise efficiency and global network of professionals. its peers repeatedly crown it offshore law firm of the year. but decades of private documents also show that even one of the offshore industry\xe2\x80\x99s brightest stars has hidden shortcomings: accepting questionable clients and failing to monitor multimillion-dollar money flows. bermuda financial regulators fined the firm\xe2\x80\x99s trust unit for breaching anti-money-laundering rules according to a confidential 2015 deal struck by appleby and the regulator. this year appleby reached a $12.7 million settlement in a lawsuit in canada in which nurses firefighters and police officers accused the firm of unquestioningly circulating money on behalf of a client who designed an alleged alleged tax-avoidance scheme. appleby and the alleged mastermind did not admit wrongdoing. family-owned asiaciti advertises itself as helping clients to accumulate and \xe2\x80\x9cpreserve wealth from the ravages of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d political upheavals and family breakups. it has attracted chinese millionaires family members of a kazakh official convicted of corruption and a broad swath of americans including doctors poker players and a colorado alfalfa farmer. the leaked files from asiaciti reveal how the firm set up trusts in the cook islands for kevin trudeau a u.s. infomercial frontman who sold millions of copies of self-help books such as \xe2\x80\x9cthe weight-loss cure \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99 don&#8217;t want you to know about.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 a chicago judge sentenced trudeau to 10 years in federal prison for criminal contempt calling him a shameless fraudster who was \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful to the core\xe2\x80\x9d and once even used his mother\xe2\x80\x99s social security number in one of his scams. appleby said in its online statement that it is committed to meeting regulators\xe2\x80\x99 standards. appleby provides advice to clients \xe2\x80\x9con legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business\xe2\x80\x9d the firm said and it does not tolerate illegal behavior. \xe2\x80\x9cit is true that we are not infallible\xe2\x80\x9d appleby said. \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we find that mistakes have happened we act quickly to put things right.\xe2\x80\x9d asiaciti did not respond to requests for comment. adrian alhassan a former compliance manager at appleby\xe2\x80\x99s bermuda office told icij that if someone is \xe2\x80\x9chellbent\xe2\x80\x9d on breaking the law there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much an offshore services provider can do. \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not the fbi\xe2\x80\x9d he said. if the law firm spent years doing background research on clients it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cget any work done.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s like cleaning a beach\xe2\x80\x9d alhassan said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cif you say that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cleaned it up at the end of the day can you really say that you\xe2\x80\x99ve picked up every piece of seaweed \xe2\x80\x9d tax havens\xe2\x80\x99 secrecy laws entice those who wish to place their wealth and dealings beyond the reach of regulators investigators and the tax collectors. the documents from corporate registries in 19 such jurisdictions reveal company names and details directors and real owners of companies created in many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest offshore hideouts. the documents come from high- and low-profile bastions of financial secrecy such as marshall islands lebanon and st. kitts and nevis a low-lying caribbean country recently hit by hurricanes. some jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x99 records are publicly available but impossible to search by an individual\xe2\x80\x99s name. others such as the cayman islands\xe2\x80\x99 registry charge more than $30 for a one-page record that provides only basic information. six registries do not make information available online. the leaked files contain more than a thousand records from antigua and barbuda a caribbean country that provides no online corporate information and more than 600000 documents from the online registry of barbados which does not list shareholders or directors. over the past decade or more the european union and other international organizations have pressured offshore havens to reform their laws and require that offshore go-betweens aggressively screen clients. progress has been slow experts say both because of the challenges of changing practices across a global web of jurisdictions and because powerful people and big companies benefit from the offshore system. they do so at the expense of the many \xe2\x80\x93 shifting the burden of taxation to middle-income taxpayers and giving multinational corporations an advantage over smaller competitors. where it hurts most is in nations struggling to provide the basics for their populations. in west africa burkina faso officials who monitor the tax payments of the largest companies doing business there work from cramped offices with broken air-conditioning units. burkina faso is among the poorest countries in the world. on average a citizen there earns less annually than the owner of an offshore company in bermuda pays in registration fees. the country\xe2\x80\x99s tax office sought $29 million in unpaid taxes and penalties from glencore the world\xe2\x80\x99s 16th-largest company and a major user of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s services. glencore protested and the penalty was reduced to $1.5 million. helping the rich get richer through offshore maneuvers is not a \xe2\x80\x9cbenign benefit\xe2\x80\x9d said harrington the copenhagen business school professor. \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the rich get richer the poor get poorer because individual wealthy people are not paying their fair share of taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t be lost on wealth managers and those in the offshore industry\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are reaching sort of french revolution levels of inequality and injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d  contributors to this story: <a href="https://www.icij.org/journalists/will-fitzgibbon/">will fitzgibbon</a> <a
