<div><div><h2>How Family that Runs Azerbaijan Built an Empire of Hidden Wealth</h2></div><div>documents peel away three layers of secret ownership in a conglomerate and lead to gold mines and overseas real estate. on october 31 2003 ilham aliyev the newly elected president of azerbaijan stood behind a podium and a profusion of white flowers to address presidents prime ministers and 2000 other guests assembled at the respublika palace. first touching the constitution and then the koran aliyev swore to serve his people. that night fireworks lit up the sky of the azeri capital baku. aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s election to lead this energy-rich former soviet republic bordering both russia and iran had been all but guaranteed. his ailing father heydar an ex-kgb officer had served in the same role for the previous 10 years. election monitors <a href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/azerbaijan/azerbaijan-elections2003.pdf">reported</a> that police had beaten and detained political opponents in line with the country\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for repression. becoming president wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s only ascension during 2003. using a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2782793-20160404-azerbaijan-01.html">network of secretive companies</a> in offshore tax havens his family advisers and allies set about acquiring expensive overseas homes and positions in the country\xe2\x80\x99s valuable industries and natural resources including the family\xe2\x80\x99s majority control of a major gold mine that has been unknown until now. the new details of the aliyev offshore empire emerge from secret records obtained by the international consortium of investigative journalists the german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and other media partners from mossack fonseca a panama- headquartered law firm that helps to set up hard-to-trace corporate structures for clients. the more than 11 million documents reviewed by icij and its partners \xe2\x80\x93 emails bank accounts and client records \xe2\x80\x93 represent the inner workings of mossack fonseca for nearly 40 years from 1977 to december 2015. the records show that in mid-2003 months before the october presidential election fazil mammadov azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s tax minister began to create ataholding which has since become one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest conglomerates. mammadov influential in his own right subsequently invited president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s family to join him cementing a potentially potent and advantageous business and political partnership. ataholding is a corporation that has significant interests in azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s banking telecommunications construction mining oil and gas sectors. its most recent corporate filing in 2014 shows it held over $490 million in assets.  the leaked files show that the tax minister created a company in panama through mossack fonseca named fm management holding group s.a. stand-in directors \xe2\x80\x94 straw men supplied by mossack fonseca \xe2\x80\x94 concealed the fact that mammadov was involved. mammadov then created a second offshore entity \xe2\x80\x93 this time a foundation \xe2\x80\x93 called uf universe foundation.  panama foundations are subject to strict confidentiality laws. anyone who discloses information about them can be fined or imprisoned.   the files show that two years later in 2005 <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/12/wikileaks-cables-azerbaijan-first-lady">aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s wife</a> the fashion-conscious collagen-infused first lady and member of parliament mehriban aliyeva became one of two managers of the uf universe foundation alongside the tax minister mammadov.  in attachments to a \xe2\x80\x9chigh importance\xe2\x80\x9d email sent to mossack fonseca in february 2005 by a lawyer representing the azeris documents proposed that then six-year-old heydar aliyev the president\xe2\x80\x99s son who is known in the files as \xe2\x80\x9ca1\xe2\x80\x9d be made the beneficiary of 20 percent of the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s proceeds. the plan also proposed that the president\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters leyla then 19 and arzu then 17 would hold 15 percent each. mammadov\xe2\x80\x99s son held 30 percent while ashraf kamilov a former tax ministry official and other former tax officials held smaller stakes. so too did ataholding\xe2\x80\x99s chairman ahmet erentok.  so the secrecy had three layers:  1) the uf universe foundation which controlled 2) fm management the panama company set up by mammadov which owned shares in 3) a united kingdom-based company named financial management holding limited. according to a flowchart shared with mossack fonseca in 2005 the uk company held 51 percent of shares in ataholding azerbaijan. while there is no doubt that these secret companies existed and paid hundreds of dollars to mossack fonseca in administrative fees it is unclear whether or not the proposed structure to benefit president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s teenage  daughters and six-year-old son and other prominent azeris was ever adopted.  uf universe foundation was closed in january 2007. then in february 2014 months after president aliyev was sworn in for his third term a london-based lawyer sought to reactivate the foundation and fm management holding group. mossack fonseca was happy to oblige and issued a $9000 invoice in exchange for reactivating the company.  most recently majority ownership \xe2\x80\x94 51 percent \xe2\x80\x94 of ataholdings was held by hughson management inc. according to ataholding\xe2\x80\x99s online annual report. a 2010 letter signed by mossack fonseca listed aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s daughters arzu and leyla and swiss lawyer olivier mestelan as directors. icij sought comments from all individuals named in this article and received no responses. in response to previous reports about the family\xe2\x80\x99s holdings the president\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman said the daughters \xe2\x80\x9care grown up and have the right to do business.\xe2\x80\x9d  despite global criticism of azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s mounting authoritarianism the aliyev regime has been a friend of successive u.s. administrations.  the united states has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the aliyevs\xe2\x80\x99 azerbaijan including millions for military and security training. azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s government is one of the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/11/how-azerbaijan-and-its-lobbyists-spin-congress/">largest buyers of influence in washington d.c.</a> and together with its lobbyists spent at least $4 million in 2014 alone burnishing the country\xe2\x80\x99s image. the country has taken members of congress on all-expenses-paid visits to azerbaijan lavishing the lawmakers with silk scarves crystal tea sets and rugs. <div class="image article__image image--medium image--floatright" id="3656"><div

a supply route to american troops in afghanistan and its potential role in the fight against isis makes the united states a reluctant critic said former u.s. ambassador to azerbaijan richard d. kauzlarich now an adjunct professor at george mason university. \xe2\x80\x9cbeing where it is \xe2\x80\x93 bordered by russia and iran in a very unstable geopolitical environment \xe2\x80\x93 is a factor that makes it among the more unique countries in the region\xe2\x80\x9d said kauzlarich who was u.s. ambassador to azerbaijan from 1994-1997.  its levels of corruption and elite control of the economy make it stand out in a part of the world where these things aren\xe2\x80\x99t unusual he added. \xe2\x80\x9cthe franchising out of economic activity to families and clans that are important for maintaining the current regime in power is not an unusual pattern\xe2\x80\x9d said kauzlarich. \xe2\x80\x9chowever it certainly has been perfected in azerbaijan.\xe2\x80\x9d the fact that aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s family can be linked to offshore companies is not new. a <a href="http://www.icij.org/offshore/offshore-companies-provide-link-between-corporate-mogul-and-azerbaijans-president">2013 investigation by icij</a> showed that aliyev his wife and his daughters owned or were otherwise connected to offshore companies. now mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s files greatly expand on what is known and disclose new companies belonging to the president\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters leyla and arzu. the documents show leyla and arzu aliyeva controlled two previously hidden british virgin islands-incorporated firms \xe2\x80\x94 kingsview developments limited and exaltation limited. it is unclear from the files the purpose of the first company but the second was incorporated in january 2015 to own a british property worth more than $1 million.  president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s eldest sister sevil is also shown in the files as the owner of another british virgin islands company setanon properties inc. again it is unclear from the files what the company was used for. in the mossack fonseca documents sevil aliyeva a composer listed her address in west london in a neighborhood where average home prices touch nearly $9 million.  mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s records reveal that the first family secured secret control of a gold mine dwarfing a smaller stake they\xe2\x80\x99d been known to hold.  in 2006 azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s government granted mining leases in the country\xe2\x80\x99s west to a consortium of companies that established the azerbaijan international mineral resources operating company ltd. under the agreement the consortium would keep 70 percent of the mine\xe2\x80\x99s profit and the azeri government received the remaining 30 percent according to a 30-year production agreement. at the time opposition politicians criticized the deal\xe2\x80\x99s lack of transparency.  in 2012 azeri journalists working with the organized crime and corruption reporting project a non-profit investigative journalism group focused on eastern europe and central asia <a href="https://www.occrp.org/index.php/en/ccwatch/cc-watch-indepth/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields">reported</a> that one of the four consortium members globex international llp was owned in turn by three panamanian companies controlled by president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s daughters and mestelan a swiss businessman and family friend.  <div class="image

href="https://www.occrp.org/en">occrp</a> reporters was azeri investigative journalist <a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2015/09/icij-condemns-conviction-member-khadija-ismayilova">khadija ismayilova</a> also a member of icij. in 2015 azeri authorities imprisoned ismayilova in what is widely believed to have been retaliation for her expos\xc3\xa9 of government corruption. authorities charged ismayilova with counts of embezzlement illegal business tax evasion and abuse of power and inciting a man to commit suicide. her sentence: 7\xc2\xbd years. \xe2\x80\x9csorting out aimroc&#39;s structure is a daunting task\xe2\x80\x9d ismayilova wrote in 2012 connecting the consortium\xe2\x80\x99s operating company with an opaque \xe2\x80\x9cpanamanian trail\xe2\x80\x9d that linked the aliyev family with the mining consortium.  mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s files reveal the leading member of the consortium londex resources s.a. which was incorporated in panama in 2005 and held 45 percent of the consortium\xe2\x80\x99s stake. the files show that in april 2008 the same <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2782794-20160404-azerbaijan-02.html">three panamanian companies</a> owned by president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s daughters and mestelan who shared control of globex international became londex\xe2\x80\x99s  shareholders. globex international held 11 percent of the consortium\xe2\x80\x99s share of the goldmine.  the trio\xe2\x80\x99s control of londex resources meant that president aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s family and inner circle controlled a majority stake \xe2\x80\x93 56 percent \xe2\x80\x93 in the consortium. there are nearly 400 documents about londex in the mossack fonseca files including invoices corporate registry records instructions to open a bank account and emails marked \xe2\x80\x9curgent request!!!\xe2\x80\x9d londex was a valuable client for mossack fonseca. the law firm invoiced londex for thousands of dollars between 2005 and 2014. in january 2016 mine workers protested before azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s parliament alleging that londex had not paid wages since 2014 when the mine was abruptly closed.  one of the protestors cumshud alasgerli a 46-year-old married father of three who worked as a geologist on the mine was interviewed by occrp. \xe2\x80\x9cmore than 200 workers can\xe2\x80\x99t get their salary\xe2\x80\x9d alasgerli said. he said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t received wages owed to him for nearly two years. \xe2\x80\x9cand the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything for us.\xe2\x80\x9d alasgerli said he has taken his employment case against londex to court. but he is not optimistic. the company and the government alike have so far failed to help. \xe2\x80\x9cthey just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to help
