<div><div><h2>Pain may not be over yet; H2FY19 earnings staring at more downgrades</h2></div><div>"moneycontrol newsthe pain may not be over in terms of corporate earnings as more downgrades are in the offing icicidirect said in a report.q1fy18 was one of the weakest quarters since 2015 as it was impacted by goods and service tax (gst) rollout which affected sectors such as domestic pharma auto fmcg paints and industrials.the impacted sectors showed significant growth in q1fy19 but as we move into q2fy19 some of the base effect disappeared while macro headwinds continued to linger.for the nifty50 index q2fy19 free float (ff) earnings growth stands at 4 percent taking into account 44 companies which reported results while fy19 earnings have been downgraded by 3.5 percent so far during q2fy19 earnings season (3% downgrade in q1fy19) said the report.it further added that assuming ff earnings growth of 6 percent for h1fy18 it seems unrealistic that we will have ff earnings growth of over 30 percent for h2fy19 as implied by consensus estimate growth for fy19 at 20 percent. this will lead to further earnings downgrades in h2fy19 said the report.another factor that will play a big role in deciding the future direction of the markets is the interest rates. divergence in the interest rate movement in the us vs eurozone japan and ems like india will continue to keep the dollar strong and put upward pressure on em bond yields.adding to the pressure is the continuation of us fed balance sheet reduction program (us$ 300 bn worth mbs and treasuries run off since oct 17) and rising fiscal deficit of the us government which is leading to a relatively tighter liquidity environment in the us (exact opposite of qe) resulting in outflows from ems including india added the report.liquidity in the banking system continues to be in deficit while nbfcs access to cp market is limited and redemptions loom which could create further pressure on this space.  liquidity in the banking system has now slipped into a deficit of rs 0.9 trillion while the issuances in the cp market continues to dip in oct  the report added.however amid all the macro headwinds there is some respite in fpi outflows as they were marginal buyers in both debt and equities in november '18 till date.october  18 fpi outflows totalled $3.8 billion in equities and $ 1.4 billion in debt while diis bought equities worth $ 3.5 billion in october  18. the net inflows into equity mutual funds for october  18 remained robust at rs 17600 crore while liquid funds attracted rs 55300 crore. one big positive takeaway is that monthly sip flows remained unfaltered at rs 7900 crore said the report from icicidirect.the fear indicator has receded from its oct 18 highs but continues to remain elevated (vix at 19.4 key equity indices below 200 dma cds spread at 151 bps strong usd and firm gold price).apart from macroeconomic indicators upcoming state election results could induce incremental volatility in stocks."</div></div>
