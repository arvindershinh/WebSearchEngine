<div><div><h2>Experts Quit Panama&#8217;s Transparency Committee Over Lack of Transparency</h2></div><div>the committee was established in the wake of the panama papers to probe panama&#8217;s financial services industry but now two out of three international members have resigned. nobel prize-winning economist joseph e. stiglitz has resigned as chairman of a panamanian government commission set up to investigate the central american country\xe2\x80\x99s offshore financial industry in the wake of the panama papers scandal saying that government officials have refused to give the panel full independence. stiglitz and mark pieth a swiss anti-corruption expert wrote panamanian  president juan carlos varela on friday that they were pulling out of the study committee because they fear government officials will limit the panel\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to investigate and keep its final report secret.  they said in the letter that government officials had declined to commit to public release of the panel\xe2\x80\x99s report and instead had insisted the group\xe2\x80\x99s findings would be the \xe2\x80\x9cproperty\xe2\x80\x9d of the government and that panamanian authorities would have \xe2\x80\x9csole responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d for any public announcements. such restrictions they said made no sense considering that the panel was set up to investigate concerns about how offshore secrecy encourages money laundering and other misconduct. \xe2\x80\x9chow can a group allegedly committed to transparency write a report that is not transparent  it would undermine our own credibility\xe2\x80\x9d stiglitz said in telephone interview friday afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cevidently they wanted us to be part of a charade to convince people they were serious when in fact they weren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d a government spokesperson issued a brief statement saying panamanian officials regretted stiglitz and pieth\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the panel and adding that the government \xe2\x80\x9cunderstands both resignations\xe2\x80\x9d are related to \xe2\x80\x9cinternal differences\xe2\x80\x9d within the panel \xe2\x80\x9cover which it won&#39;t intervene.\xe2\x80\x9d  the statement added: \xe2\x80\x9cthe government of panama reiterates its firm and real commitment to transparency and international cooperation\xe2\x80\x9d and how showed this commitment \xe2\x80\x9cwith clear actions that have been recognized by the international community.\xe2\x80\x9d in their resignation letter stiglitz and pieth urged that the independent committee disband. stiglitz said he and pieth will likely issue their own separate report which will make the case that being more transparent will help panama\xe2\x80\x99s economy in the long run. panamanian authorities established the panel \xe2\x80\x93 appointing four members from panama and three from outside the country \xe2\x80\x93 in april.  president varela called for the creation of the committee after the international consortium of investigative journalists and more than 100 other media partners began publishing stories exposing how a panama-headquartered law firm mossack fonseca had set up hard-to-trace shell companies for politicians professional athletes organized crime figures and money launderers from around the world. the resulting media firestorm forced panama\xe2\x80\x99s government to respond. varela said at the time panel was formed that his administration was committed to \xe2\x80\x9cbulletproofing\xe2\x80\x9d panama\xe2\x80\x99s financial services sector \xe2\x80\x9cagainst threats from people and groups who want to use it for illegal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d the commission is supposed to make recommendations to varela and other panamanian officials and write a report on their findings by the end of this year.  stiglitz and pieth said that committee members had agreed during a meeting in new york in early june that panama\xe2\x80\x99s government needed to make the committee\xe2\x80\x99s report public no matter what its findings. pieth said in an <a href="http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/wir-schreiben-keine-geheimberichte/story/10350377">interview friday with tages-anzeiger</a> a swiss newspaper that collaborated on the panama papers investigation that he and stiglitz decided to resign after an official with panama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign ministry sent them a \xe2\x80\x9crude\xe2\x80\x9d letter on july 29 that said the government wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t commit to releasing the report.  \xe2\x80\x9cwe were a little shocked\xe2\x80\x9d stiglitz told icij. \xe2\x80\x9cbefore we took the action to resign we made an effort to contact the vice president or president and we were rebuffed. we never got through.\xe2\x80\x9d pieth told tages-anzeiger that he and stiglitz agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t write secret reports. if you want to have a clean financial center transparency is the top priority.\xe2\x80\x9d in their letter to varela stiglitz and pieth wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cwe believe that transparency is at the core of our mission \xe2\x80\x93 transparency in panama\xe2\x80\x99s corporate and financial sectors and transparency regarding the independent committee\xe2\x80\x99s process findings and final reports. given our commitment to transparency and the fact that global standards are moving towards more disclosure not less we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that our findings be made public and that independent committee members shall be allowed to speak freely about our findings recommendations and beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  stiglitz is a professor at columbia university in new york and shared the 2001 nobel prize in economics. pieth is a professor of law and criminology at basel university and spent more than 20 years as the chair of the organisation for economic co-operation and development\xe2\x80\x99s working group on corporate bribery. pieth and stiglitz\xe2\x80\x99s resignation letter noted that the country has made progress on meeting international standards aimed at combating money laundering and tax evasion but said the country needs stronger laws and better enforcement when it comes to overseeing law firms accounting firms and other key players in the offshore financial system. because international standards are getting stronger they said panama needs to do more to keep up.  if not they said \xe2\x80\x9cthe gap between panama and these global standards will increase with substantial potential damage to panama\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and its place within the international community.\xe2\x80\x9d later friday afternoon after fielding questions about the two panel members&#39; resignations panamanian officials distributed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3006379-cei-interim-report-english-panama-transparency.html">nine-page document</a> that describes itself as the committee&#39;s july 2016 &#8220;interim report.&#8221;  the document recommends more reporting requirements for offshore companies and suggests other changes in the country&#39;s regulatory practices. it says panama should try to reduce and if possible eliminate &#8220;all forms&#8221; of &#8220;illicit&#8221; money flows.  stiglitz and pieth however said in their letter to president varela that they had played no role in writing the document. had they done so they said they would have made recommendations that &#8220;go far beyond&#8221; those that appear in the document.  &#8220;neither of us agreed to that report and it was prepared and submitted without discussion within the committee&#8221; stiglitz and pieth wrote. &#8220;indeed one of us is not even in receipt of the final interim report after submitting numerous requests.  while there may be conclusions of that report with which we agree that report should not be considered the work of the committee.&#8221; they added that it &#8220;appears strange and non\xe2\x80\x90transparent&#8221; that a report of the committee be submitted without approval of stiglitz the committee&#39;s chair.</div></div>
