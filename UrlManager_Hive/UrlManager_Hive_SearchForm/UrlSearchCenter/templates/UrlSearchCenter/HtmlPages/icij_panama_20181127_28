<div><div><h2>Diamond Mine with Offshore Ties Leaves Trail of Complaints</h2></div><div>the panama papers reveal a network of shell companies linked to a mining operation that has been accused of environmental harms and unpaid taxes. once or twice a week as the sun sets on the city of koidu in eastern sierra leone residents pack their things and head uphill. a diamond mine is about to blow. some families leave behind boiling cooking pots moved on by police and security forces before miners set off charges to blast away the dirt and rock that hide the diamonds. for some in this city of more than 100000 residents the explosions remind them of the mortar bombs that fell when koidu was attacked by rebels during the west african nation\xe2\x80\x99s civil war in the 1990s. the earth shudders. buildings crack. and koidu residents\xe2\x80\x99 lives go on as they have ever since an international mining conglomerate resumed digging in koidu 13 years ago. <div class="image

for the stability of koidu city\xe2\x80\x9d he said. in 2016 months after the lawsuit was filed the central government suspended mayor lamina from office amid allegations of financial mismanagement within koidu city. an audit found a handful of administrative infractions including an employee who carried city checkbooks with him on holidays and about $8500 in unaccounted payments to contractors and third parties. no specific charges were made against lamina. lamina says the suspension is an effort to silence him. media reports suggested that the order came from the office of president ernest bai koroma. \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawsuit did not go down with my political superiors\xe2\x80\x9d lamina told icij. a spokesman for the president told icij the suspension was a \xe2\x80\x9clocal council

leone\xe2\x80\x99s civil war when records indicated that the steinmetz family\xe2\x80\x99s private foundation signed off on a deal to pay $1.2 million to buy half of the mining license issued by the national government for koidu mine. koidu limited became one of mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s busiest mining industry customers with hundreds of emails and attachments sent over more than a decade that detail mundane to urgent administrative tasks accounts at five banks in sierra leone and london and a flurry of loans worth $170 million.  the sierra leone mining company is one of 131 companies set up by mossack fonseca connected to steinmetz and the company that sits at the top of his corporate empire bsg resources according to the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s internal files. these companies include diamond mine operators traders and polishers in namibia botswana angola liberia and the congo. one company diacor international limited reported producing a variety of diamonds including some in \xe2\x80\x9cfancy colours.\xe2\x80\x9d the records indicate that diacor booked more than $1 billion in sales each year from 2011 to 2013. steinmetz\xe2\x80\x99s deals in guinea sierra leone\xe2\x80\x99s northern neighbor drew much of mossack fonseca\xe2\x80\x99s attention. in august 2014 authorities in the british virgin islands ordered mossack fonseca to provide hundreds of pages of correspondence payments meeting minutes financial transactions and more from three companies in relation to a criminal investigation into bsg resources.  the inquiry related to allegations that people connected to bsg were being investigated in multiple countries for bribes paid to secure mining rights in guinea. in documents later shared with mossack fonseca bsg\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers confirmed it was under investigation by authorities in britain switzerland and the united states. it also challenged the government of guinea on the grounds that the government unlawfully stripped bsg of its mining rights.  bsg resources declined to answer specific questions for this article. the company said \xe2\x80\x9cit uses offshore companies and related structures as part of its legitimate and fiscally responsible tax planning\xe2\x80\x9d and discloses information when and where required. bsg told icij that it has \xe2\x80\x9cno familiarity\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9ca very large number of companies\xe2\x80\x9d of the 131 mossack fonseca companies that appeared connected to steinmetz and bsg within the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s files. one of the two demonstrators who died during the 2007 protest against koidu limited was aiah momoh a 30-year-old father of three girls. a memorial sign says aiah died \xe2\x80\x9cduring a peaceful demonstration \xe2\x80\xa6 against koidu holdings s.a. limited for corporate abuse of community rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  while the company\xe2\x80\x99s operations were briefly halted by the government a commission of inquiry later cleared the

all we had in this family.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2015 the community took their grievances from the streets to the courtroom. after years of unheeded requests for payment  the koidu city council sued koidu limited\xe2\x80\x99s parent octea limited claiming that the company owed $684000 in unpaid property taxes. not paying property taxes mayor lamina wrote in an affidavit \xe2\x80\x9cdeprived my community of the much needed resources to undertake development activities. \xe2\x80\xa6 i believe the community that owns it&#8217;s resources cannot be deprived of benefiting from their own minerals and have to go cap in hand begging.\xe2\x80\x9d koidu maintained it was exempt from taxes but that it was committed to its corporate social responsibilities. in april four days after the release of the panama papers justice bintu alhadi of the high court of sierra leone ruled that octea and koidu limited were separate entities and octea was not technically the mine\xe2\x80\x99s owner. as a result the judge found octea had no duty to pay property tax. \xe2\x80\x9cthe secrecy of tax havens and the complexity with which companies can arrange their businesses makes it difficult for developing countries to get a fair deal in the share of revenue from their natural resources\xe2\x80\x9d said tatu ilunga a former tax lawyer and senior policy advisor on tax for oxfam america. lamina who says that he believes that the central government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the power to suspend him from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office continues to operate as if he is still mayor. he believes he will soon be reinstated and said the city plans to appeal the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in the property tax case. \xe2\x80\x9ci started seeing myself as a lone ranger\xe2\x80\x9d lamina told icij.
