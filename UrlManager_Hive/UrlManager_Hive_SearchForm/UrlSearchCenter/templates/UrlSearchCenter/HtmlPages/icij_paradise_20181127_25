allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> hundreds of pages of leaked documents from the <a href="http://icij.org/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> detail how the private equity giant routed its ownership of two large u.k. commercial rental properties through a string of subsidiaries in two well-known tax havens: luxembourg and the island of jersey a u.k. dependency off the coast of france. under the structure renters in the u.k. would effectively pay rent to a jersey-based trust fund that would ultimately transfer the money to blackstone subsidiaries in luxembourg according to the confidential documents. the records describe plans for large loans to pass between the blackstone subsidiaries holding the u.k. properties. these loans appear to have shifted blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s profits from the u.k. to luxembourg avoiding any tax anywhere according to reuven avi-yonah professor and tax expert at university of michigan law school. in response to questions about these tax structures a law firm for blackstone sent icij a statement saying \xe2\x80\x9cblackstone\xe2\x80\x99s investments are wholly compliant with u.k. and international tax laws and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d blackstone said that it had acquired these structures \xe2\x80\x9cfrom institutional investors\xe2\x80\x9d and that the arrangements were commonplace for such real estate investments and had been used for decades in the u.k. the configurations according to the statement \xe2\x80\x9cwere adopted after appropriate advice was taken from leading tax and legal advisors.\xe2\x80\x9d today icij is releasing two confidential reports that provide detailed descriptions of these maneuvers. these reports were prepared for blackstone by two giant accounting firms <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4253825-chiswick-park-2013-tax-structure-report-1.html">pricewaterhousecoopers</a> and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4256520-deloitte-project-genesis-structure-report.html">deloitte</a>. you can read them in full below. avi-yonah reviewed the blackstone reports at icij\xe2\x80\x99s request and spoke about them in the following q& a with icij reporter spencer woodman. the interview has been edited for length and clarity. <strong>spencer woodman: do these blackstone structures share similarities with other methods of corporate tax avoidance that you&#8217;ve seen </strong> <strong>reuven avi-yonah:</strong> yes. generally the idea is that you want to shift income from entities located in comparatively high-tax jurisdictions like the u.k. to other entities in relatively low-tax jurisdictions like bermuda or jersey. <strong>w: what\xe2\x80\x99s your takeaway from these blackstone documents in particular </strong> <strong>a:</strong> my sense is that both transactions are pretty similar. they manipulate the tax structures in sometimes fairly aggressive ways in order to achieve a result of both a deduction that blackstone can use to reduce its taxable income in the u.k. plus no withholding tax (tax u.k. authorities retain before income departs the country). <strong>w: is this what you have called \xe2\x80\x9cdouble non-taxation\xe2\x80\x9d  what is that </strong> <strong>a:</strong> in my mind it refers to when two countries do not tax any income of a company (with a corporate presence of some kind in both) allowing that income to be accumulated in the lower-tax jurisdiction. <strong>w: can you give a summary of the purpose of the loans made between the blackstone firms in luxembourg </strong> <strong>a:</strong> they\xe2\x80\x99re moving income in the form of interest payments from where the properties actually are to luxembourg which is famous for not taxing foreign-sourced income. interest that comes from the u.k. or any other country can go untaxed in luxembourg. there are special rulings whereby the luxembourg tax administration enters into sweetheart deals with various companies to subject them to a tax rate that is way below the nominal tax rate.\xc2\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">(however the exact terms of blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s tax treatment in luxembourg are not clear.)</span> and the problem with something like that is that luxembourg appears to be a good citizen of the e.u. in the sense that it has a nominal high tax rate and has a treaty network \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not bermuda it\xe2\x80\x99s not an official tax haven. and yet under the table it does these things that result in a very very low tax rate. so luxembourg plays the role of tax haven in this story similar to that typically played by bermuda or the caymans. but because it is a member state of the e.u. and it has treaty networks and so on it is possible to move income \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps in the form of interest payments \xe2\x80\x94 from the u.k. to luxembourg without being subject to withholding tax in the u.k. <em>editor&#8217;s note: in 2014 icij\xe2\x80\x99s <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/luxembourg-leaks/">lux leaks</a> files detailed <a href="https://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/your-head-spinning-5-tips-understand-lux-leaks-files">confidential tax rulings</a> from luxembourg officials that grant companies favorable treatment for moving their income to the country.</em> <strong>w: in terms of these intercompany loans what is the purpose of the interest payments between blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries </strong> <strong>a:</strong> generally interest payments on a loan is deductible from corporate income taxes. if you have a hundred pounds of income and you pay 90 pounds in interest then you only pay tax on ten. it\xe2\x80\x99s a much smaller tax than if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the 90 percent interest deduction. <strong>w: and in the blackstone case to whom is this interest actually being paid </strong> <strong>a:</strong> well the interest payments follow the inter-company loans and ultimately end up in luxembourg \xe2\x80\x94 subject to a very reduced tax rate \xe2\x80\x93 and so the money can then sit there and pay no tax. <strong>w: can you talk about taxes on rental income in the context of these blackstone documents </strong> <strong>a:</strong> these properties obviously generate significant income especially in london which is a very expensive place to live and to have offices. all of that income would be normally subject to full u.k. income tax and even though the u.k. has repeatedly cut its corporate tax rate it\xe2\x80\x99s still something like 19 percent so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like zero or anywhere close to it. i think hrmc [her majesty&#8217;s revenue and customs] could be significantly concerned about a transaction in which this type of income is not subject to tax because it is offset by deductible items going to a jurisdiction where it is taxed at zero-point-zero-one percent or whatever it is. and that appears to be what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here. <script src="//assets.documentcloud.org/viewer/loader.js"></script><br /><script>
