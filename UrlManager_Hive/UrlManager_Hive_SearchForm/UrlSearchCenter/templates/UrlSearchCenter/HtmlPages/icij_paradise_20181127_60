sweden\xe2\x80\x99s national broadcaster. previously she worked on the guardian\xe2\x80\x99s all-female data team \xc2\xa0on top of crunching numbers for both the panama papers and paradise papers investigations. follow her on <a href="https://twitter.com/helenabengtsson">twitter here</a>.</em> my first job as a developer i programmed using pascal [an early programming language launched in 1970] and the second longer one where we did all the crazy stuff i used basic. this was just as windows was launched. ibm at that time actually launched an alternative to windows called os2 so they kind of tried to beat microsoft. my last job before going to university i worked using that operating system. i was building programs for an airline company so i made a program tracking work hours for pilots and flight attendants because they can\xe2\x80\x99t fly after a certain amount of landings and time in the air. they need to rest and every airline keeps track of that so they don\xe2\x80\x99t end up booking too many hotel nights you want to optimize the time they stay at home so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay extra. well i learned i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of taking on a new programming tool and i knew how programming worked. i don\xe2\x80\x99t program a lot at my work now but it helped when i got into journalism school and we were introduced to the concept of data journalism in 1994. it was very early but i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of it&#8230;because i know how computers and spreadsheets work. i think i had seen a spreadsheet back then on lotus 1-2-3 but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have email yet. in 1996 and 1997 my internship bosses at svt sent me to a nicar boot camp at columbia university. ever since then i\xe2\x80\x99ve had this unique knowledge. i saw that my fellow interns were struggling more because they were sharing ground with established reporters but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody doing what i was doing. in one way i was that strange girl in the corner of the room using excel but nobody really understood what i was doing. on the other hand nobody was really competing with me either. and credit to my bosses they left me alone. i still spend 80 percent of my time in excel because i think it&#8217;s the best tool to get an overview of what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at. i don\xe2\x80\x99t do data visualizations at all. i look for stories. when i scrape i\xe2\x80\x99m very old-fashioned and people are going to laugh at this but i use a very old fashioned tool called perl which has been abandoned now because everyone uses python. i use perl for scraping and i use postgres [an open source relational database management system] to store data if it\xe2\x80\x99s a large database. we have a more visual journalism data team so we actually have two data teams right now and if you want to work on the data at the same time you put it in an sql database [a collection of data structured in tables such as postgresql or mysql]. i will never learn a tool for the sake of it. i will only learn a tool when i need it for a project. until recently we had a really hard time getting maps in sweden so up to two or three years ago i\xe2\x80\x99d just use google maps or tableau to do simple data visualizations that help me see a pattern. you usually have a journalistic idea where you go find data for it but you should always be very open because sometimes that idea shows you something completely different. when you have those big data sets i almost look at them as if i were interviewing a person. you get it and look at it like what do we have here  can we group things  how much data is there  what is it about  sometimes i just scroll through data just to see what pops out at me. then i start asking questions through the data. it\xe2\x80\x99s like when you meet an interesting person and you might ask them a question then you listen to the answer and you ask the next question. it\xe2\x80\x99s very seldom you have a dataset out of the blue. you most likely have some sort of journalistic idea. i think it has something to do with the access to data. i think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of data available for education and it&#8217;s a subject matter that is very close to people. everyone has gone to school a lot of people have kids in school or work in a school so it\xe2\x80\x99s a subject matter that lies close to people and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of great data there. also in almost every country the school system isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair. i haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet found a country in which the school system is fair. my uncle went to university but other than him i\xe2\x80\x99m the first generation in my family to go to university and for me it\xe2\x80\x99s really important that everyone who wants to level out those differences in school should be able to. that\xe2\x80\x99s what school is about but it\xe2\x80\x99s also very clear when you look at data that it\xe2\x80\x99s not. you have schools that can\xe2\x80\x99t take care of those people that can\xe2\x80\x99t raise the levels of those students and that\xe2\x80\x99s something i over time doing these stories have got engaged in and find to be really important. that\xe2\x80\x99s what i like about data journalism. you can look for yourself. you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on a press release or a researcher or an organization that made a report. you can actually look for yourself you can decide your own angle or several angles if you want to do that and you can decide your own agenda and what you want to do with that. you can also break myths that go around. many people are quick to believe what we call anecdotal evidence which is not evidence at all. many years ago in sweden there was a reporter who wanted to prove there was a suburb that was very segregated. she said there are only people with an immigrant background living in a valley and on the other side on a hill only people who were born in sweden and whose parents were born in sweden. she called it the swedish hill and the immigrant valley. i pulled the data on that because we have good geographical data in sweden. you can go down to a block level in stockholm. i saw the split was more 49 percent to 51 percent. so i said to her that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. it may look like that but just because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got black hair doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean you have an immigrant background. you can\xe2\x80\x99t really go out and look at people to make that judgment you have to look at what the data says. she was really angry at me because that was her feeling. but i said we can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about this like it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact because it\xe2\x80\x99s not. even though everyone says so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s true. that\xe2\x80\x99s what i love about data journalism \xe2\x80\x94 you can go in and both break myths but also find out if it is true. you can have a feeling that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_counties">home counties</a> [editor\xe2\x80\x99s note: the home counties are the counties surrounding greater london \xe2\x80\x94 typically populated by the upper-middle-class] or rich privileged white kids are overrepresented at the top universities in the uk but it\xe2\x80\x99s better if you can show them the numbers because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t you can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything about it. i want to explore the different conditions people have not just kids but also adults. recently i was taken aback because not only our conservative party but also the social democrats which has always been a party from the left were using very harsh words when it came to the asylum seekers in sweden. i was astounded. i\xe2\x80\x99d been in the uk for three years and i followed the news but you can\xe2\x80\x99t follow everything so i was really astounded when i got back. i think one of the things that we are forgetting and this might sound old-fashioned is that people come from different circumstances that could be a lack of money or language or culture. sweden is a very equal place. we pay a lot of taxes because you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t earn that much money and because schools are free roads are free all those kinds of things. i think we are getting more we call it a two-thirds society where one third has everything and two-thirds have very little and i find that very interesting. i\xe2\x80\x99d like to look at that more at demographic data. one of the things i\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about i come from a small town rural i grew up on a farm out in the middle of nowhere with a very small high school and i\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered would i be able to do what i\xe2\x80\x99ve done if i were brought up now  would my teachers have encouraged me to do things  is there a difference now  i think there is. it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder today than it was when i was growing up to even out the different circumstances that we have which i think is one of the things society should do. so that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit old-fashioned but that\xe2\x80\x99s a story i want to look into once we get out of the elections. i would like to be better at getting data out of free text to use scraping and programming to find patterns. for instance court documents are just stored as pdfs in sweden. what kind of stories could we do if we had access to a large quantity of those  are there differences in judging or sentencing  \xc2\xa0also working with the documents of the panama and paradise projects has made me think a lot about unstructured data and what could be made if we had more knowledge in processing text. but before anything else i have to get through the swedish election in september.</div></div>
