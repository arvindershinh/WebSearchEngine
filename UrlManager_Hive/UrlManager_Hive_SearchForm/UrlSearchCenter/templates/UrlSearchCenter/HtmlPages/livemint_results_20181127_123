"earnings to rise 15% year-on-year stable quarter-on-quarter modest quarter-on-quarter decline in refining and chemicals offset by growth in reliance jio and reliance retail" said macquarie research in its report dated 8 october. according to the market research firm refining segment s operating profit will decline 30% year-on-year due to lower product cracks tighter crude differentials and a temporary fluid catalytic cracker (fcc) shutdown. as a result (grms) are expected to be soft and come in between $10-10.2 per barrel. gross refining margins is what a refiner earns by turning crude oil into final products. ril s grm which was $12 per barrel in the september quarter of 2017-18 fell to $10.5 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018-19. in q2 the benchmark singapore complex grm rose from $6.0 to $6.2 led mainly by higher fuel oil cracks. ril however does not produce fuel oil at its jamnagar refinery in gujarat. the facility the world s single largest oil refinery can process 1.24 million barrels of oil per day. "we expect ril's grm to come in at $10 per barrel down $0.05 a barrel compared of the last quarter. while product margins should come in flat" said goldman sachs equity research in a report dated 10 october. on the petrochemicals front analysts expect ril s operating profit to be in double digits mainly driven by higher sales volume and help from rupee depreciation. during the july-september quarter ril had raised prices of its key petrochemical products to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. bulk chemicals traders suppliers for ril s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in q2 2018-19 while year-on-year increase is 17-61%. in the september quarter the rupee fell 5.55% while crude oil prices rose 1.58%. on the telecom front morgan stanley expects reliance jio to have added about 35 million subscribers in q2. average revenue per user (arpu) was seen declining by 2% quarter-on-quarter leading to 13% quarterly revenue growth.  some increase in opex (operating expenditure) could compress the earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin but we expect 10% quarter-on-quarter ebitda growth" said morgan stanley research in a report dated 9 october. ebitda is the measure of operating profit of a company. reliance retail meanwhile is expected to have grown 7% quarter-on-quarter in q2 with stable margins and over 4% operating profit. reliance retail is india s largest retailer by revenues. on the exploration and production front ril will continue to lag and is expected to report losses analysts said.</div></div>
