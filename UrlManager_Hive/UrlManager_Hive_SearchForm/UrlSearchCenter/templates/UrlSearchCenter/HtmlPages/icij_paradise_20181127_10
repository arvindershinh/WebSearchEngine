show low arizona. in july 2015 at the peak of summer a tlc caregiver was feeding orange slices to marsha campfield a smiley 23-year-old who lived for puzzles bracelets and rounds of frisbee with her father. before the clock struck five the caregiver started to make a phone call and looked away. as the caregiver did marsha\xe2\x80\x99s parents later alleged an orange wedge with some of the peel still attached became lodged in marsha\xe2\x80\x99s windpipe. she choked blacked out and died. the risks of injury death and lawsuits were something that tlc\xe2\x80\x99s owner doug kaplan was not entirely unprepared for. a former client had previously sued one of his healthcare facilities for alleged negligence and abuse. the case was dismissed in 2006 but kaplan later took steps to protect himself from any adverse court judgments or jury verdicts. he started with a breakfast meeting with a lawyer in phoenix the following year. joining them was adrian taylor the laconic managing director at the cook islands branch of <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-firm-managed-millions-carousel-millionaires-fraudsters/">asiaciti</a> a firm specializing in offshore companies and trusts. kaplan told taylor that he was about to open a high-risk care facility for mentally disabled patients. another source of kaplan\xe2\x80\x99s concerns was a dispute with former employees who claimed unpaid overtime. kaplan was confident of a settlement he told taylor but worried it could \xe2\x80\x9copen the floodgates\xe2\x80\x9d for hundreds of others. kaplan and the lawyers mulled over \xe2\x80\x9cworst-case scenarios\xe2\x80\x9d for either of those concerns according to notes of the meeting. would a trust in the cook islands protect his current wealth kaplan asked. what about money he made in the future. would that be safe too  how easily could a court break his trust  asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s taylor reassured the arizona business owner and \xe2\x80\x9cgave him the usual \xe2\x80\x98peace of mind\xe2\x80\x99 responses.\xe2\x80\x9d about two months later kaplan had a trust whose name reflected more the ecosystem of its pacific island home than his business\xe2\x80\x99 location in arizona: coral reef. kaplan told icij that he created the trust for different reasons including a desire to protect his savings from \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous claims\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpredatory lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d kaplan said that ultimately he changed his mind about starting a new venture in arizona held by the trust. both the company and the trust he said were \xe2\x80\x9cempty\xe2\x80\x9d shells that never held any money bank accounts or signed any deals. \xe2\x80\x9cthe coral reef trust was intended to be for my personal assets and had nothing to do with tlc\xe2\x80\x9d kaplan said. kaplan\xe2\x80\x99s business was one of many successes that followed taylor\xe2\x80\x99s 12-day trip across the continental united states. the details of the 2007 tour are contained within \xe2\x80\x9cmarketing visitation\xe2\x80\x9d reports two of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">13.4 million files</a> contained within the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a>. asiaciti is a well-known player in the international trust circuit and serves some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest and highest-profile investors and moguls. the u.s. tours continued into 2015. one of the company\xe2\x80\x99s specialities is the creation of cook islands trusts \xe2\x80\x93 hard-to-pierce safe holdings used to manage wealth and assets. though prized by the rich the publicity-shy and in some cases the fraudulently-inclined they are viewed with suspicion by investigators tax collectors and law enforcement. while <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/secret-world-offshore-mega-trusts/">offshore trusts</a> can be innocuous tools for parents to safeguard their children\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance or for pet owners to indulge their favorite tabby cat or fluffy dog judges have sentenced and jailed americans who used trusts to frustrate creditors block legal orders or hide ill-gotten gains. while rules have tightened since 2007 including the addition of <a href="http://www.klgates.com/tax-evasion---nowhere-left-to-hide-10-27-2016/">disclosure requirements</a> to the internal revenue service and european union rules that require countries to <a

information</a> offshore trusts remain largely impenetrable. \xe2\x80\x9cif someone has an offshore trust it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely difficult and expensive for people to get to it\xe2\x80\x9d said jay adkisson a california attorney author and expert witness. for many says adkisson the thought of moving money offshore makes them feel \xe2\x80\x9ca little like james bond.\xe2\x80\x9d asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s u.s. tours were valuable entrees into north america a market teeming with what experts call the \xe2\x80\x9clower wealthy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 clients with a few million dollars to spare. asiaciti executives made two trips across the country in 2007 with packed schedules that included lunch at a private members\xe2\x80\x99 club in new york city homespun dinner in miami a meet-and-greet at a family office in denver and parlays with texas representatives of a major american bank. taylor and asiaciti did not respond to questions but referred icij to a <a href="https://www.asiacititrust.com/2017/11/06/response-to-media-coverage/">previous statement</a> in which it said the company complies with applicable laws and regulations and denies \xe2\x80\x9cany implication of wrong doing.\xe2\x80\x9d   while not every meeting ended in success (some were dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9cwoft\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cwaste of f****** time\xe2\x80\x9d) new clients included a texas landowner who wanted no one to know that he leased land to an oil company and a pair of los angeles-based motivational speakers. some americans asiaciti courted in 2007 already had reasons to seek refuge from u.s. laws. others would face investigations in the years to come. kaplan of tlc supported living services for example had made his money in health care in indiana and the grand canyon state including the home in eastern arizona where campfield died. employees and clients sued kaplan\xe2\x80\x99s companies four times according to public records. in one case a former employee sued for $5 million and alleged he was fired for refusing to falsify documents. a former client claimed that the company subjected her to physical abuse. the cases were settled and dismissed respectively.\xc2\xa0kaplan said he strongly disputes allegations that anyone was asked to falsify documents and contested the other allegations of wrongdoing. in january 2017 campfield&#8217;s parents resolved the case out of court with tlc and other defendants who denied wrongdoing. the suit did not name kaplan personally. \xe2\x80\x9ctlc has always carried significant liability insurance for these types of claims\xe2\x80\x9d kaplan said. \xe2\x80\x9cthe case was settled by the insurance company with a payment to ms. campfield\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xe2\x80\x9d kaplan told icij that the coral reef trust was terminated in 2014 and had no role in the lawsuit over campfield\xe2\x80\x99s death which he called a \xe2\x80\x9ctragic accident.\xe2\x80\x9d the campfields did respond to requests for comment. on a mild morning almost two weeks after meeting tlc\xe2\x80\x99s kaplan and after stops in five other u.s. states asaiciti\xe2\x80\x99s taylor was in chicago for the last day of his tour. by lunchtime gregory bell a computer science graduate with an mba was a satisfied new client meeting notes recall. bell created the blue sky trust in the cook islands in july 2008 and handed it control of a swiss bank account. two months later bell\xe2\x80\x99s life unravelled when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/petters-ponzi-coleman/petters-aide-in-tears-as-she-recounts-going-to-fbi-idusn0337204720091104">fbi agents raided</a> the home and office of his business partner thomas petters. u.s. officials accused petters of fraud and money laundering central to a $3.7 billion ponzi scheme that was the largest in u.s. history at the time. single mothers and retirees who invested half a century of savings were among the victims. petters was charged in october that year and sentenced in april 2010 to 50 years in prison for orchestrating the massive fraud. \xe2\x80\x9calmost any time there\xe2\x80\x99s a sizeable ponzi scheme there are allegations people are taking some of the money offshore\xe2\x80\x9d said <a href="http://www.kathybphelps.com/">kathy b. phelps</a> an attorney who co-wrote \xe2\x80\x9cthe ponzi book.\xe2\x80\x9d while trusts are not unbreakable phelps said victims and enforcement agencies can struggle to find them or even know they exist. \xe2\x80\x9cand once you\xe2\x80\x99ve done that\xe2\x80\x9d phelps said \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the question of whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the cooperation\xe2\x80\x9d of the country where the trust is created and of the lawyers who helped set it up. in 2009 the securities and exchange commission filed fraud charges against bell and his illinois hedge fund. while he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t central to the underlying fraud authorities said the sec complaint alleged that bell was \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21124.pdf">blinded</a>\xe2\x80\x9d by multimillion-dollar fees he earned from it and misled investors about petters\xe2\x80\x99 background and the details of the scheme. the sec named asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s trust arm as a co-defendant and asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s taylor who met bell in chicago supplied affidavits in criminal and civil cases that were helpful to the case against bell. u.s. authorities alleged that bell moved $15 million to his cook islands trust to avoid creditors and the government. authorities said they wanted to recover millions of dollars \xe2\x80\x9cbefore the money disappears overseas.\xe2\x80\x9d asiaciti\xe2\x80\x99s files show that bell made insistent evening phone calls and a fax to lawyers in july 2008 as the ponzi scheme neared collapse. \xe2\x80\x9cmr. bell is anxious to submit the applications and i would like to provide him with an update tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d bell\xe2\x80\x99s american lawyer wrote about paperwork needed to open a bank account. bell was arrested in july 2009 and pleaded guilty to intentionally defrauding investors. he helped return the $15 million to the united states and was sentenced to serve 72 months in prison. contacted by icij bell declined to comment. asiaciti also cooperated with u.s. authorities and the company was never charged. but it could never quite shake its involvement. once emails show asiaciti struggled to persuade a bank where it was hoping to help open a client\xe2\x80\x99s account that it bore no responsibility for the fraud into which it was ultimately drawn after meeting bell in chicago all those years ago. said taylor about the bank\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cun*******believable.\xe2\x80\x9d</div></div>
