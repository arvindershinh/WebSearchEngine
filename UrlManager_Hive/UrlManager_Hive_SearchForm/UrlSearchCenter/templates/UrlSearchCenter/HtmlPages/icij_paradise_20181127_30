<div><div><h2>Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s Offshore Trust Mystery</h2></div><div>paradise papers files include revelations of a battle to control part of former south african president\xe2\x80\x99s offshore empire. details about an offshore trust linked to former south african president nelson mandela have emerged from the paradise papers a trove of financial records from the offshore law firm appleby. the mad trust believed to short for mandela\xe2\x80\x99s clan name madiba was set up in 1995 in the isle of man a british dependency in the irish sea. the previous year the anti-apartheid revolutionary mandela became south africa\xe2\x80\x99s first post-apartheid president. the trust existed in near-total secrecy until 2015 \xc2\xa0more than one year after mandela\xe2\x80\x99s death when lawyers representing his estate contacted appleby to try to wrest control of its million-dollar bank accounts. \xc2\xa0a summary of the case contained within an appleby spreadsheet from the paradise papers labeled the case \xe2\x80\x9chighly confidential.\xe2\x80\x9d on one side mandela\xe2\x80\x99s estate argued that the trust and money it held belonged to the former president. on the other mandela\xe2\x80\x99s one-time friend lawyer and mad trust administrator said the money was for charity not mandela. the lawsuit underscores the shadowy ownership rules of offshore trusts popular entities often used to manage personal wealth or hide money from creditors former spouses or courts. in 2015 lawyers for mandela\xe2\x80\x99s estate filed a lawsuit in south africa against the late president\xe2\x80\x99s estranged former lawyer ismail ayob to force the money\xe2\x80\x99s return. ayob created the mad trust without mandela\xe2\x80\x99s consent lawyers argued and its bank accounts \xe2\x80\x93 which at one point held $2.1 million \xe2\x80\x93 belonged to mandela. \xe2\x80\x9cthe money held in the mad trust accounts is the personal money of the late mr mandela and is not owned by the trustees of the mad trust if indeed such a trust exists\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers for mandela\xe2\x80\x99s estate argued according to court documents obtained by icij\xe2\x80\x99s south african media partners the <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2017-11-16-the-curious-tale-of-mandelas-paradise-papers-link/">financial mail</a> and <a href="http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-11-16-mandelas-isle-of-man-trust-mystery">amabhungane centre for investigative journalism</a>. ayob the signatory of the mad trust testified that he created the trust at mandela\xe2\x80\x99s request to receive personal donations. money came from foreign beneficiaries ayob said in his court affidavit \xe2\x80\x9cinvariably in large currency amounts\xe2\x80\x9d via check or bank drafts made out in mandela\xe2\x80\x99s name. mandela \xe2\x80\x9cwanted the trust created so that he could give away money to people abroad who\xe2\x80\x99d been \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 or needed it \xe2\x80\x94 he was always very generous\xe2\x80\x9d ayob told icij media partner the financial mail in an interview. part of the money in the mad trust went to the widow of erich honecker the last president of east germany \xc2\xa0ayob told the financial mail. \xe2\x80\x9cat the time she was really struggling as she had no pension\xe2\x80\x9d ayob told the financial mail. \xe2\x80\x9cso mandela said he\xe2\x80\x99d like to assist her\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cmr mandela as a trained lawyer was perfectly familiar with the concept of a trust\xe2\x80\x9d ayob wrote in a court affidavit. \xe2\x80\x9cin fact i formed some thirty trusts on his instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers for mandela\xe2\x80\x99s estate countered that ayob\xe2\x80\x99s version of events was largely \xe2\x80\x9cfact-free\xe2\x80\x9d and unreliable. \xe2\x80\x9chis assertion that he established the mad trust at the request of mr mandela is a good example\xe2\x80\x9d the estate\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer said in an affidavit. \xe2\x80\x9cwhere  when  how and why did mr mandela give the instruction  why did he open the account before the trust deed was signed  why was the trust never registered \xe2\x80\x9d the estate\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer also argued that ayob with whom mandela had a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/17/southafrica.artsnews">public falling out</a> should no longer have been involved with the trust since mandela had demanded he quit all his trusteeships in 2004. in june 2015 appleby hired by the estate to give an opinion of the trust\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy concluded that the mad trust was too broadly defined and did not identify any concrete beneficiaries of the money. the trust was not exclusively a charitable trust appleby wrote because documents declared that the trust\xe2\x80\x99s assets could be used for any company or organization. \xc2\xa0as a result appleby concluded the mad trust \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not exist and has never existed.\xe2\x80\x9d in november 2015 a south african court held that mandela\xe2\x80\x99s estate owned the mad trust\xe2\x80\x99s three bank accounts and that ayob had no authority over them. the funds which had grown to more than $1.2 million were transferred to the estate.
