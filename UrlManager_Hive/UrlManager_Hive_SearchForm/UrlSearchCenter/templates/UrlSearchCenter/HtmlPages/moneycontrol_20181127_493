"someone who makes mistakes will have to pay the penalty so why is the aviation ministry protecting those who are making mistakes  if the airlines are not making a profit this might make them work more professionally" d sudhakara reddy founder of apai told the paper.jet airways and air india are already in crisis and the airline industry is looking for some relief from the aviation ministry and major airlines including indigo and spicejet reported losses in their q2 fy19 results."</div></div>
