<div><div><h2>Room Of Secrets Reveals Glencore&#8217;s Mysteries</h2></div><div>law firm\xe2\x80\x99s internal files reveal oil mineral and grain trader glencore signed secret deals and loaned millions to a high-risk business partner. the glencore room at <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">appleby\xe2\x80\x99s bermuda</a> office wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to look at. across from the women\xe2\x80\x99s bathroom the room dedicated to one of the offshore law firm\xe2\x80\x99s most important clients held a filing cabinet a computer a telephone a fax machine and a checkbook. once in 2009 it was turned into a party space. \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my b-day\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the party giver. \xe2\x80\x9ccake is on the 2nd floor in the glencore room.\xe2\x80\x9d but modest as it was the room held plenty of secrets. \xe2\x80\x9cglencore\xe2\x80\x9d is glencore plc one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest mining and agriculture conglomerates ranked <a href="http://fortune.com/global500/list/">16th on the fortune global 500 list</a> of largest corporations with revenue last year of more than $170 billion. it is the world\xe2\x80\x99s <a

merchant of chickpeas; its products touch virtually anyone who has driven a car held a smartphone or eaten a slice of bread. glencore has also been a major presence inside the offices of government investigators who have probed fined and criticized the commodity giant for years. <script type="text/javascript" src="https://data.afr.com/scripts/pym.min.js"></script> <script> new pym.parent(\'glencore\' \'https://data.afr.com/2017/11nov/glencore-appleby-burmuda-icij/index.html\' {}); </script> now a leak of offshore financial data from the glencore room and beyond has yanked back the curtain and some of glencore\xe2\x80\x99s biggest secrets are open to scrutiny. the data called <a href="http://icij.org/investigations/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> comes from the offices of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">offshore law firm appleby</a> and corporate services provider estera which operated together under the appleby name until 2016. copies of <a href="http://icij.org/paradisepapers">6.8 million of files</a> documenting decades of activity inside the bermuda main office and other offices were obtained by german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and 94 media partners. the files on glencore contain confidential emails <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164962-glencore-minutes-page-268-and-others.html">board minutes</a> tax restructuring diagrams billion-dollar loan contracts sales agreements and frank conversations about what rules could and could not be bent as part of a \xe2\x80\x9crisk/reward debate.\xe2\x80\x9d the records shed light on how a global colossus aided by a trusted offshore law firm uses financial havens to cloak its lucrative dealings in secrecy even as it wields vast influence in resource-rich but corruption-plagued parts of the world. the appleby documents show that glencore diverted millions of dollars through bermuda and other tax havens and fought off lawsuits and tax bills in europe and the caribbean. but it is in the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest country \xe2\x80\x93 the democratic republic of the congo where glencore acquired an interest in major copper mines \xe2\x80\x93 that glencore\xe2\x80\x99s history is revealed in greatest detail through the leaked documents. over the years investigators have tried to piece together the full extent of the relationship between glencore and daniel gertler an israeli businessman with friends in high places in the drc who helped glencore negotiate access to the sprawling katanga mine. the new revelations unearthed in more than a thousand pages of documents set out <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4175182-overflow-minutes-directors-amp-shareholders.html">how glencore provided a $45 million loan</a> to a gertler-controlled company while he helped glencore strike a deal for the mine with drc officials. the leaked files provide the most detailed evidence yet of the behind-the-scenes lobbying and the money flows that helped katanga in which glencore was just a shareholder at the time acquire mining licenses. the files also raise questions about how katanga which was later taken over by glencore managed to pay a price that critics have viewed as less than the licenses\xe2\x80\x99 real value. in response to questions from icij <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/glencore-responds-icijs-questions">glencore said</a> that the price for the mining licenses was agreed to before gertler entered the negotiations and that its loan to the company controlled by gertler was \xe2\x80\x9cmade on commercial terms\xe2\x80\x9d with standard provisions in place. glencore also said that it had recently moved most of its bermuda entities to switzerland or the united kingdom. as a new century began the democratic republic of the congo was a chaotic place. a long-running civil war ended in 2003 and the country\xe2\x80\x99s first elections in 40 years were held in 2006. under the leadership of president joseph kabila the drc set up a panel to review mining contracts with foreign companies. the review spread confusion through corporate headquarters in europe asia and the americas including the offices of katanga mining ltd. the canadian-headquartered mining company held rights to valuable copper deposits in the drc and glencore already a katanga shareholder was eying the mine with ever greater enthusiasm. by early 2008 with the drc\xe2\x80\x99s contract review looming and with hundreds of millions of dollars in investment at stake katanga and its shareholders had to act. initially katanga had believed that it had little to worry about according to one of hundreds of fly-on-the-wall revelations found in meeting minutes from appleby\xe2\x80\x99s client archive. despite the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical overtones\xe2\x80\x9d of the government\xe2\x80\x99s review panel katanga\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive told board members in february 2008 the country was unlikely to want a bigger stake under an existing joint venture agreement. months later however the drc state mining company that negotiated mining contracts with private investors began to insist on changes to katanga\xe2\x80\x99s proposals as to how the mine would be run. the congolese government mining company made a series of counterproposals that were \xe2\x80\x9cquite unacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d the katanga board agreed at a june 2008 meeting. then the board hit on a plan. \xe2\x80\x9cdan gertler who had a substantial indirect interest in the company should be given a mandate from the board to negotiate with the drc authorities\xe2\x80\x9d katanga\xe2\x80\x99s board agreed at the june 23 lunchtime meeting held at the hilton hotel by the zurich airport. among the katanga board members was glencore shareholder and director aristotelis mistakidis. gertler an israeli diamond and copper dealer who held his shares in katanga through an offshore trust was well-connected in the drc. he was particularly close to president kabila\xe2\x80\x99s righthand man augustin katumba mwanke. lawyers for gertler told icij that the two men only became acquainted \xe2\x80\x9con a personal basis\xe2\x80\x9d after katumba\xe2\x80\x99s retirement from government. known to many congolese as \xe2\x80\x9cgod the father\xe2\x80\x9d katumba was also known as the man to see for anyone seeking access to the drc\xe2\x80\x99s enormous natural resources reserves. on one occasion gertler katumba and their families vacationed together aboard a yacht on the red sea before katumba was to check into an israeli hospital for an operation. after the operation went awry and katumba slipped into a coma gertler rushed in 13 doctors including three from london. \xe2\x80\x9cin the 12 days i spent in the hospital dan didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me\xe2\x80\x9d katumba later wrote in his memoirs. \xe2\x80\x9che left everything his business his family his life. he was at my bedside day and night.\xe2\x80\x9d in katumba\xe2\x80\x99s telling gertler saved his life. gertler\xe2\x80\x99s closeness to the regime has drawn international scrutiny. in 2001 two related united nations reports on the exploitation of the drc\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources \xe2\x80\x93 including \xe2\x80\x9cconflict diamonds\xe2\x80\x9d or precious stones that are traded to finance feuding armies \xe2\x80\x93 had described gertler\xe2\x80\x99s friendliness with kabila and reported that one of gertler\xe2\x80\x99s companies received a lucrative diamond-mining monopoly. one of the reports alleged that as part of the deal gertler agreed to exchange diamonds for the delivery of weapons to congolese armed forces at a time when human rights observers reported that feuding national armies militias and warlords were killing and raping indiscriminately. years later in 2013 an expert panel led by former u.n. secretary-general kofi annan alleged in a report that gertler\xe2\x80\x99s companies had acquired mining assets from the drc for an average of one-sixth of their commercial value. gertler\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers told icij that he denied allegations in the 2001 u.n. reports and that he had not been given an opportunity to comment before publication. the united nations has not cited him since 2001 his lawyers said. gertler\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers told icij that his companies were not given the opportunity to respond to allegations made in the 2013 report allegations that the companies \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically refute.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmr dan gertler is a respectable businessman who contributes the vast majority of his wealth and time to the needy and to different communities amounting to huge sums of money\xe2\x80\x9d his lawyers told icij. \xe2\x80\x9che transacts business fairly and honestly and strictly according to the law.\xe2\x80\x9d the financial times bloomberg anti-corruption nonprofit global witness and others have spent years piecing together deals involving glencore gertler and the drc\xe2\x80\x99s leaders as part of an effort to understand how one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest countries in terms of its natural resources has remained so poor. now the leaked files from appleby\xe2\x80\x99s archives have revealed month-by-month accounts of the ways glencore relied on gertler\xe2\x80\x99s assistance. soon after the june 2008 agreement in zurich to enlist gertler katanga celebrated some good news. \xe2\x80\x9cdan gertler had fulfilled his mandate very well\xe2\x80\x9d the company\xe2\x80\x99s outgoing ceo told the board of directors in a conference call a month later according to appleby\xe2\x80\x99s internal files. \xe2\x80\x9cthe meetings over the last 2 days had been extremely productive.\xe2\x80\x9d a new memorandum of understanding called for an additional $10 million in future royalties to be paid the government but all in all katanga\xe2\x80\x99s board expressed its approval of the agreement. in october 2008 glencore appointed a glencore managing director steven isaacs interim ceo of katanga. and soon the drc\xe2\x80\x99s state mining company was back with more demands including \xe2\x80\x9cadditional monies\xe2\x80\x9d totaling $585 million for a signing bonus. to resolve this \xe2\x80\x9cvitally important matter\xe2\x80\x9d the board decided that four katanga directors including isaacs and mistakidis \xe2\x80\x9cwould have a discussion with dan gertler\xe2\x80\x9d again. as the directors worried over the government\xe2\x80\x99s demands for more money the company was hurting for cash. records show katanga was seeking money from potential investors to help it continue trading. then a windfall came through. in february 2009 katanga announced to the toronto stock exchange a sizable loan from glencore and others including lora enterprises a british virgin islands company owned by a trust that benefits gertler\xe2\x80\x99s family. details were sparse. in 2014 global witness the u.k.-based anti-corruption nonprofit group published documents showing that glencore had lent the capital that gertler\xe2\x80\x99s company in turn lent to katanga. gertler\xe2\x80\x99s company and glencore then acquired new shares in katanga. now documents and exchanges discovered in appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files provide further insight into how glencore\xe2\x80\x99s loan to gertler\xe2\x80\x99s company kept the well-connected israeli by glencore\xe2\x80\x99s side as a katanga stakeholder as katanga entered the final months of negotiation with the drc government. here\xe2\x80\x99s how the loans came about: on jan. 9 2009 when negotiations with the drc were still flailing glencore sent its bermuda lawyers documents that included one called a term sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cglencore shall use its vote at the board of katanga to seek to have dan gertler exclusively mandated to assist katanga in finalising the terms of the joint venture\xe2\x80\x9d the term sheet stated. one document authorized glencore\xe2\x80\x99s in-house counsel and mistakidis the glencore director who also sat on katanga\xe2\x80\x99s board to approve a $45 million two-year loan to lora enterprises. the term sheet shows that glencore had the right to demand repayment of the loan if the joint venture gertler was helping to negotiate with the drc wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finalized within a few months. in other words glencore\xe2\x80\x99s $45 million loan to gertler was contingent on the drc authorities agreeing to a deal with katanga. \xe2\x80\x9cthe lora loan agreement reflects appropriate terms negotiated on an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length basis\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers for gertler told icij and its partners adding that it was not uncommon in african mining transactions for the lender to demand repayment of a loan if a joint venture fails. the lora loan was repaid in full in 2010 and \xe2\x80\x9cneither lora enterprises nor mr. gertler nor any company or person related to them received the loan funds directly\xe2\x80\x9d lawyers said. in march two months after agreement was reached on the term sheet katanga\xe2\x80\x99s ceo announced to a board meeting that he had met with gertler in kinshasa the congolese capital. \xe2\x80\x9cas a result . . . revised proposals were made by katanga which has resulted in the resolution of most issues\xe2\x80\x9d with drc authorities according to the minutes of the meeting. not only was the deal moving ahead the ceo said but katanga had persuaded the drc to accept a signing bonus worth $140 million instead of more than $580 million. the reduced bonus meant that katanga would pay one quarter of what almost all other mining companies would have paid on average per ton of copper at the time according to elisabeth caesens <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/drc-110317.html">an expert in congolese mining deals</a> who reviewed the leaked documents. the katanga-drc deal was inked in july 2009 weeks after glencore had increased its stake in katanga again to near total control. \xe2\x80\x9cthe documents reveal that if gertler failed to get that contract amended glencore could have demanded immediate repayment of the $45 million loan\xe2\x80\x9d caesens said. \xe2\x80\x9cin doing so glencore disregarded the many red flags mr. gertler\xe2\x80\x99s connections and track record should have raised and exposed itself to the risk of non-compliance with anti-corruption rules\xe2\x80\x9d said caesens who advises the carter center the nonprofit human rights group founded by former u.s. president jimmy carter. glencore\xe2\x80\x99s chairman told icij media partners during the company\xe2\x80\x99s 2017 annual meeting that its background checks on gertler were \xe2\x80\x9cextensive and thorough.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">in a written response glencore also said the signing bonus deal was decided before gertler\xe2\x80\x99s mandate.</span> lawyers for gertler said \xe2\x80\x9cclearly and unequivocally\xe2\x80\x9d that allegations that loans were used to make corrupt payments are \xe2\x80\x9cfalse and without any basis whatsoever. . . . mr. gertler vehemently rejects them absolutely.\xe2\x80\x9d katanga did not receive preferential treatment for the joint venture as a result of gertler\xe2\x80\x99s involvement his lawyers told icij and media partners. all negotiations were carried out on a legitimate basis the lawyers said. in february 2017 glencore bought gertler\xe2\x80\x99s stake in major drc mines including katanga for more than $500 million. after 10 years of business negotiations and thousands of pages of documents circulated through offshore companies glencore and the drc now own the katanga mines almost in their entirety. five months before glencore bought out gertler the u.s. justice department settled a bribery case brought against the new york-based hedge fund och-ziff capital management group under the foreign corrupt practices act. the justice department\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the case made mention of lora enterprises which the settlement described as controlled by an unnamed israeli \xe2\x80\x9cdrc partner\xe2\x80\x9d widely believed to be gertler. the justice department alleged that an och-ziff company lent lora enterprises $110 million in november 2010 and that between then and february 2011 \xe2\x80\x9cdrc partner caused approximately $20 million in corrupt payments to be made to various drc officials\xe2\x80\x9d including to unnamed \xe2\x80\x9cdrc official 2\xe2\x80\x9d believed to be augustin katumba mwanke. in sept. 2016 an och-ziff subsidiary pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $413 million in penalties and fines. the justice department\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with och-ziff \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not constitute evidence of anything against mr. gertler\xe2\x80\x9d his lawyers said. \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent such agreement is alleged to relate to mr. gertler it did so without any participation by him or any opportunity to provide any comment whatsoever. \xe2\x80\xa6 mr. gertler rejects absolutely any allegations of wrongdoing or criminality by him.\xe2\x80\x9d drc president joseph kabila did not respond to repeated requests for comment. katumba died in a plane crash in 2012. lora enterprises was not charged in the och-ziff case which did not involve glencore. glencore\xe2\x80\x99s sharp-elbowed business practices in post-conflict central africa surprise no one familiar with the company and its history. glencore is the corporate successor to the trading firm founded by marc rich the notorious financier who spent years as a fugitive on the fbi\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmost wanted\xe2\x80\x9d list before being pardoned by president bill clinton on his last day in office in 2001. a child refugee from nazi-occupied belgium rich attended private schools in manhattan before dropping out of new york university to work at a metals trading firm philipp brothers now phibro where he met his future partner pincus green. in 1974 they moved to switzerland to form marc rich + co ag \xe2\x80\x93 later changed to glencore xstrata plc \xe2\x80\x93 trading iron and metals before expanding into russian and african oil european grain and more. rich as a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106">vanity fair profile</a> would later put it \xe2\x80\x9cflourished as a lender and a barterer with third world and eastern-bloc countries which were strapped for cash or in debt and which had commodities for collateral that rich could get hold of and sell for fat profits.\xe2\x80\x9d in 1983 rich and green were indicted in the united states on charges related to tax evasion and evasion of an embargo against trade with iran during the iranian hostage crisis. rather than face the 65-count indictment rich fled. he continued to lead the company until 1993 when an audacious attempt to corner the global zinc market went awry leaving the firm with $172 million in debt. pressured by partners rich sold his majority stake in 1994 for a reported $600 million. the company was reborn as glencore the name reportedly drawn from the first two letters of each word in global energy commodities and resources. glencore thrived without rich and in 2011 was listed on the london stock exchange. overnight a handful of its shareholder directors became multimillionaires. ceo ivan glasenberg became so rich that the swiss village where he lives r\xc3\xbcschlikon was able to cut municipal taxes for all other residents as a result of the increased taxes he paid. in 2013 glencore completed its takeover of mining giant xstrata in one of the largest-ever corporate mergers in the natural resources sector creating one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest commodity traders and mining companies. the swiss-based company has worked hard to improve its image. it has funded antimalaria programs in zambia sponsored a turtle research boat for indigenous australians and helped deworm cows alpacas and llamas in peru. still glencore is never far from negative headlines. in recent years protesting employees have alleged dangerous working conditions and unfair wages in canada australia burkina faso namibia and colombia. australian scientists linked the company\xe2\x80\x99s mining operations to air and soil contamination that had caused lead poisoning in children. after allegations of tax evasion in zambia the european union\xe2\x80\x99s development bank suspended loans in 2011 to a company subsidiary with a copper mine in zambia. in the philippines in 2012 and 2013 paramilitary forces killed three villagers during protests against a glencore copper and gold mine and in argentina in 2017 a court suspended gold and copper mining operations partly owned by the company after pollution complaints. glencore has denied allegations of wrongdoing in all of these instances. through it all glencore\xe2\x80\x99s high-end offshore lawyer of choice has been appleby. appleby had worked for marc rich for years on business matters including real estate even after his 1983 indictment in the united states. when news broke of rich\xe2\x80\x99s death in june 2013 a senior appleby lawyer emailed glencore\xe2\x80\x99s top lawyer: \xe2\x80\x9con behalf of the partners and staff of appleby please accept our sincerest condolences upon the passing of mr marc rich. a true corporate titan of our times.\xe2\x80\x9d glencore was a longtime major client of appleby which spun off a large part of its corporate services and private wealth management business in 2016 as an independent company named estera. taken as a group glencore\xe2\x80\x99s stable of 107 offshore companies made the conglomerate one of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s top clients. glencore has worked with appleby on major projects with code names such as project usa (when it bought canada\xe2\x80\x99s largest grain handler in 2012) project great game (a business deal in russia) and projects ranger sunset everest and pebble. a glencore employee told appleby that the company did not have a complete chart showing all its offshore entities \xe2\x80\x9cmainly because it would take up one wall :).\xe2\x80\x9d the glencore room was intended to offer the company a \xe2\x80\x9crobust physical footprint\xe2\x80\x9d on the zero-tax island of bermuda according to a 2014 email from an appleby managing director. the special room could have helped glencore keep its taxes in check by convincing any curious tax collectors that the company was doing real business from the island experts told icij. glencore employs 800 people at its home office in switzerland\xc2\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">according to appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files</span>. at its financial subsidiary in bermuda the company had only an appleby employee who moonlighted as an official stand-in glencore director for a \xe2\x80\x9cvery limited number of hours.\xe2\x80\x9d the employment contract was designed to keep the stand-in director below thresholds that would invoke payroll taxes and social security insurance coverage according to a file note prepared by appleby in may 2014. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files also reveal internal concerns about demands that glencore a reliable source of revenue made on the bermuda law firm over the years. once in 2006 an appleby lawyer said he would refuse to sign a document that stated that $2 billion in loans from glencore to its subsidiaries would \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit the company.\xe2\x80\x9d his reason was that he had not read the document\xe2\x80\x99s contents. \xe2\x80\x9cthis does raise the issue of our responsibility as directors and how we can discharge that to the satisfaction of the client and ourselves in an acceptable time frame and for a reasonable remuneration\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cthat risk/reward debate is very much the topic.\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer ultimately signed the document as requested. requests from glencore that appleby employees backdate documents sparked repeated flare-ups appleby\xe2\x80\x99s client files reveal. in 2009 glencore asked appleby to sign a board approval motion on may 6 that was dated april 28. glencore was being \xe2\x80\x9csneaky in my view\xe2\x80\x9d an appleby administrator in bermuda said. in late 2013 an appleby lawyer wrote a colleague to complain that glencore was asking her to sign a document stating in effect that a glencore company had approved a decision before it had in reality been made. \xe2\x80\x9cglencore are up to their old tricks\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer wrote. glencore declined to comment on the practice of backdating documents. the company complies with its tax obligations it told icij. appleby did not reply to detailed questions but issued a press release that stated: \xe2\x80\x9cwe are an offshore law firm who advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business. we do not tolerate illegal behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d the two sides agreed to end retroactive dating of documents in 2014 according to notes from meeting held in zurich. far from switzerland and far from the special room in bermuda congolese people who live and work near the mines have their own concerns about glencore\xe2\x80\x99s operations. maj. leonie kamanda a national park supervisor from kisenda a town close to another glencore mine in the copper-rich katanga region has watched for years as the park\xe2\x80\x99s vegetation turns yellow \xe2\x80\x93 a result she believes of mineral runoff from copper and cobalt diggings inside and around the park. kamanda works within a protected hunting reserve where hippos apes and buffalo coexist with mining operations run by various corporate parents. mining companies don\xe2\x80\x99t respect the environment kamanda said and deforestation is rife. glencore says its environmental policies and practices meet and exceed international and industry standards. despite living in the drc\xe2\x80\x99s richest mineral region 60 to 70 percent of the inhabitants of the region that is home to glencore\xe2\x80\x99s operations are reported to live in poverty. it had been at least 10 years since some towns close to the mine have had running water said christian sapu kankonde of the institute for good governance and human rights. \xe2\x80\x9cthe population finds itself left to its own devices to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe are the ones on the ground\xe2\x80\x9d said daudet kitwa kalume a human rights attorney in kolwezi the largest town close to katanga mining\xe2\x80\x99s joint venture. \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you go around town you can practically read the misery on people\xe2\x80\x99s faces.\xe2\x80\x9d
