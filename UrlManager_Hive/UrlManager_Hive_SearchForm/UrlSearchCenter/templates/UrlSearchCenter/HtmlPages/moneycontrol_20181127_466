<div><div><h2>Former CEA reckons it is a bad idea to use RBI reserves for current spending: Report</h2></div><div>"moneycontrol newsthe ongoing rift between the reserve bank of india (rbi) and the government is set to play out as the former's board of director meets later today.representatives of the finance ministry and some independent directors are expected to debate with rbi governor urjit patel over issues ranging from msme credit to the central bank's reserves and the management of surplus.it was reported that the government wants rbi to part with nearly a third of its reserves which total around rs 9.7 lakh crore. however former chief economic advisor arvind virmani told the financial express that asking for more dividend from the rbi for current spending is not the way to go."conversion of reserve assets into dividends to be used for current expenditures is a bad idea from a fiscal perspective" he was quoted as saying.virmani believes rbi's evaluation of the risk may be conservative in nature but neither rbi nor the government has come up with the best way to deal with the issue."to the extent that there is an excess of reserves with the rbi they should be used to write off outstanding loans to the government. this would be a book transaction to clean up the balance sheets of the rbi and the government consistent with the whole of government approach which will also be net positive for markets" he said.out of rbi's total reserves rs 6733 crore is capital and other reserves rs 2.5 lakh crore is the contingency fund and rs 6.71 lakh crore is the currency and gold revaluation reserves.commenting on the government s insistence on relaxing the prompt corrective action (pca) framework virmani said this is a specific technical issue and to resolve it there have to be technical professional committees with the representation of stakeholders.rbi has restricted lending operations of 11 public sector banks with high non-performing assets and low capital adequacy ratio (car) under the pca framework.tensions between the government and the central bank have been rising since the beginning of the year over multiple issues. they escalated further when the finance ministry started discussions about invoking section 7 of the rbi act for the first time ever in october.this was followed by rbi deputy governor viral acharya delivering a speech in which he warned the government against threatening the autonomy of the central bank.invoking section 7 allows the government to issue directions to rbi."</div></div>
