<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>singapore telecomunications' (singtel) continued investments in bharti telecom - the holding company of bharti airtel - reflects its bets on the long-term growth potential of india's telecom market and also signals the possible easing of financial pressures on incumbent carriers later this year  analysts said.global rating agency fitch expects gradual price discipline in the financially stressed sector to return and “drive mid-single digit revenue recovery in the calendar year 2018 itself  following calendar year 2017’s falls”.india’s telecom industry  weighed down by nearly rs 7 lakh-crore of debt and battling brutal price wars since reliance jio’s entry over a year back  has had another poor quarter recently. and jio’s renewed aggression on the pricing front after it cut rates twice last month in quick succession has yet again stoked fears of another prolonged price war resulting in continuing erosion of telecom revenues and profits for several quarters.some experts  in fact  expect airtel  vodafone india and idea cellular to compete aggressively to counter jio’s recent rs 49 per month offer to jiophone users to stop the mukesh ambani-led carrier from cornering millions of their 2g feature phone users.but nitin soni  director (corporates) at fitch ratings  is cautiously optimistic  saying singtel’s further investment “underscores our view that the telecoms industry may have reached bottom and that pressure on incumbent indian telcos should gradually ease this year”.in fact  soni even downplayed potential business risks for incumbents triggered by the new jiophone offer  saying that in an era of large-screen mobiles it is unlikely that too many 2g users would opt for the new jiophone offer since the 4g data experience on a small-screen feature phone would be very limited.fitch has recently revised its sector outlook on india's telecoms market to stable in 2018  from negative in 2017  as it feels industry consolidation has strengthened the competitive position of the country's top three telcos - bharti airtel  jio and the emerging vodafone-idea combined entity - even as smaller operators have exited the sector.acute financial stress has led to rapid consolidation in the telecom industry  which is set to leave bharti airtel  jio and the emerging vodafone-idea cellular merged entity as the only three dominant telcos.singtel had said on monday it would raise its stake in bharti airtel by investing rs 2 649 crore in the telco’s holding company  bharti telecom  through a preferential share issue  proceeds of which will be used to cut debt. with this investment  the total stake of singtel and affiliates in bharti telecom rises to 48.90%  from 47.17%  with bharti enterprises owning 50.1% of the sunil mittal-led company.the singaporean carrier’s economic interest in airtel will also rise by 0.9 percentage points to 39.5% while the indian promoter’s share will stand diluted to 27.08% from 27.93% before.brokerage nomura said singtel management’s strategy to tap into growth opportunities like india is evident  especially since “bharti airtel is set to emerge as a beneficiary of the accelerated industry consolidation and normalising competitive intensity in the wireless space with revenue and subscriber market share accretion and arpu recovery likely by fy20”.bharti airtel’s shares dipped marginally by 0.17% to close at rs 438.75 on the bombay stock exchange on tuesday.</div></div>
