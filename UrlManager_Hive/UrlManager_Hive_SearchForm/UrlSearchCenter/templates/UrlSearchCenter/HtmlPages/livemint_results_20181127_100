said in slides on its website. microsoft has improved profitability in the division as it adds customers letting it run services more efficiently and spread costs across more clients. with cloud demand rising microsoft has also said it will continue to invest in new products and data centers. as a result capital expenditures will increase this fiscal year but at a slower pace than last year chief financial officer amy hood said in an interview. microsoft is seeing more large and long-term cloud deals and more deals that make use of so-called hybrid cloud where some applications and data stay in a customer s facilities and some move to microsoft s hood said. that boosts sales of windows server sql databases and azure. microsoft structures these contracts so customers of the traditional software also get the ability to move to the cloud.  it s really customer-friendly  hood said.  they can move to azure on their terms their timing and at attractive pricing.  the company is also close to finalizing the acquisition of code-sharing website github inc. for $7.5 billion in stock a deal aimed at accelerating moves into the cloud and artificial intelligence. hood reiterated her previous forecast for that deal to add to profit in fiscal 2020. microsoft has been upgrading its cloud software and has also revamped its sales force to do a better job getting customers to buy. in july 2017 microsoft laid off thousands of sales workers and starting hiring for different kinds of roles including some experts in particular industries and product needs. the changes have paid off piper jaffray & co. analyst alex zukin wrote in a recent note to clients.  customers even suggest that sales talent has been leveled up  he wrote noting that the overhauled sales force is better at selling a group of products that work together rather than individual programs. in the last few days of the quarter microsoft announced a deal with volkswagen ag to underpin that company s efforts in connected cars and cloud services. the hope among microsoft investors is that azure keeps growing and drives sales in other parts of the business as well as customers invest in new applications

surface hardware gained 14 percent. on a conference call microsoft executives said second-quarter sales for the cloud unit will be $9.15 billion to $9.35 billion while revenue in the productivity
