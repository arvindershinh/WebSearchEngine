two-wheeler space start-ups are mushrooming at break neck speed all over the world promising to address every practical need of the consumer and make everyday life simpler and engaging. because of their smaller size start-ups are agile and respond to market changes faster than large conglomerates.electric vehicles are the future of mobility and more and more countries are joining the bandwagon. while car makers are powering their way forward in this space one school of thought is that the market will adopt electric two-wheelers much faster.besides two-wheelers address mobility needs at the primary stage. very often two-wheelers are the first personal vehicle in a family. this gives car makers the window to position their brand in the consumers' households with the prospect of marketing their cars to the same buyer at a future date.this helps the companies save on marketing spend and builds goodwill. in other cases companies are able to learn from start-ups about efficient running of operations cutting down costs and improving technology."</div></div>
