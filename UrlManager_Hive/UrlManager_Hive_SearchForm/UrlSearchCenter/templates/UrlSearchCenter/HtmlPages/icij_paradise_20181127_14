<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div><em>last year will fitzgibbon spoke with chris jordan the australian tax official leading the coordinated global response of organization of economic cooperation and development (oecd) nations to the paradise papers. jordan the commissioner of the australian tax office also heads the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/tax/forum-on-tax-administration/jitsic/">joint international tax shelter information and collaboration</a> (jitsic) network a group of tax officials from more than 30 countries. </em> <em>jitsic members met for an emergency meeting in paris three days after the <a href="/panamapapers">2016 panama papers</a> investigation was unveiled. in late 2017 they met again \xe2\x80\x93 this time remotely \xe2\x80\x93 to discuss the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a>. </em> <em>joining chris jordan in this conversation was mark konza the australian tax office\xe2\x80\x99s international deputy commissioner who is the ato\xe2\x80\x99s liaison with jitsic.</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous lag that is unavoidable in these matters\xe2\x80\x9d jordan said pointing to an australian investigation that took five years to conclude but led to almost $1 billion in <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/general/the-fight-against-tax-crime/news-and-results/project-wickenby-has-delivered/">recouped money</a> and 46 convictions. jordan said that investigation known as <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/general/the-fight-against-tax-crime/news-and-results/project-wickenby-has-delivered/">project wickenby</a> taught him that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to write things off before investigations have been allowed to run their course.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit took a long time to investigate that data and those schemes. everyone said there was nothing in it and that we were oppressive and wrongly investigating matters.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[we tend] to be attacked by people who are being influenced by those who don\xe2\x80\x99t want investigations to proceed\xe2\x80\x9d he said. when it comes to the paradise papers jordan said \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to be clear and honest with the community. \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be prejudicing people you have to build proper criminal cases. we think the paradise papers will necessarily take time for their value.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe way these things work is that after about 5 years the community turns around says \xe2\x80\x98ah.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe paradise papers from an initial glance seem to be more focussed on the corporate level\xe2\x80\x9d said mark konza. \xe2\x80\x9cthe panama papers were a bit more at the individual level.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cat the corporate level you don\xe2\x80\x99t just get people hiding money&#8230; you [find] them engaging in arrangements that they think are within the law.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s material we haven\xe2\x80\x99t previously had access to so it\xe2\x80\x99s very exciting to see background communications and primary documents.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe big thing about this is that you look at emails and you get to look at the real purpose\xe2\x80\x9d said jordan. \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an email where some of the lawyers are complaining about a large corporation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cand they say \xe2\x80\x98up to their old tricks\xe2\x80\x99 and ask to backdate proxy nominations. that could be quite interesting to revenue authorities if it looks perfectly legal but if things weren\xe2\x80\x99t signed when they said they were.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we do is go through the database we identify all the taxpayers that might be affected\xe2\x80\x9d jordan said. \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s a larger company we might already have a team that has been working on the company for some years. the team goes through it assesses the data. if it\xe2\x80\x99s individual taxpayers who don\xe2\x80\x99t have teams.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not just a tax issue it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious financial crime issue.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit really hit home to everyone and us at the tax authorities that we need to focus on the prime players and how do we disrupt them. where are the big players that are putting this all together  in some ways mossack fonseca and appleby [the offshore law firms] are just putting the companies together.\xe2\x80\x9d tax advisers known as intermediaries create these complex schemes on purpose jordan said. many times multinational companies and their advisers will come into the australian tax office to dispute a tax decision. \xe2\x80\x9cadvisers put the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4163292-offshore-structure-of-the-wl-ross-group.html">spaghetti diagram up</a> present you with a series of reports and they flop all this on the table and say \xe2\x80\x98who are you to challenge these experts \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we did is faithfully go through the reports page by page looking through the technical analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9coften it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to get dragged into the spaghetti.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthey want you to play on their turf. often what we do is look at the economic outcome in australia. what was the true profit earned here and has the tax been paid on that  it\xe2\x80\x99s better to stand back and say \xe2\x80\x98what are they really making in australia \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d put differently jordan said the company\xe2\x80\x99s tax advisers \xe2\x80\x93 whom jordan calls the \xe2\x80\x9cstory tellers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cdelivered the fairy tale.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthese experts have been writing stories for so long they are starting to believe their own fairy tales. some of these emails give us some insights into that. they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about putting the story together.\xe2\x80\x9d jordan gave the hypothetical example of a company that wants to pay a tax of five percent on its revenue. the advisers then ask in effect \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98how can we work back from that to effectively create a story that justifies that [5 percent] as an end result \xe2\x80\x99 they\xe2\x80\x99re starting with something they think is acceptable then they get the transfer pricing experts in and justify that.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get sucked into that\xe2\x80\xa6we tell our staff you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get in behind the powerpoint presentation because the powerpoint is just the story.\xe2\x80\x9d leaks like the paradise papers which contain emails from clients to lawyers about the real purpose behind creating an offshore company can give insights into how those stories are put together jordan said. some of the groundwork had been set by the joint international tax shelter information and collaboration response to the panama papers in april 2016 konza said. jitsic is now a network where tax officials know one another personally and can jump on the phone more easily than ever he said. within three days after the panama papers more than 30 of jitsic members met in paris going around the room to say what they knew or didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the leak of documents from mossack fonseca a panama-founded law firm. \xe2\x80\x9cafter the panama papers\xe2\x80\x9d said konza \xe2\x80\x9cwe realized we needed to have a rapid response protocol. i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just drop everything and go to paris.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the <a href="/paradisepapers">paradise papers</a> broke we called a meeting of the advisory group [which involved several 1 a.m. meetings for konza to accommodate other time zones] to brief all the members.\xe2\x80\x9d every country that had slices of data started to analyze them konza said and talk to one another about what they were seeing. \xc2\xa0many countries didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity for data analysis themselves konza said so one advantage of jitsic is that countries can join in and learn from each other&#8217;s data analysis. the advisory group has 60 days to tell the entire network what it knows about the data and to recommend a course of action konza said. \xe2\x80\x9cthe paradise papers give governments the push to bring on some new laws some new powers some new funding. the community has a strong sentiment of outrage. so governments clearly react to that\xe2\x80\x9d said jordan. \xe2\x80\x9cone of the enduring benefits of the panama papers is that we now have the laws and we have the government buy-in and commitment to support us.\xe2\x80\x9d in october last year jordan revealed to the australian financial review that the <a href="http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/the-panama-papers-yields-50-million-with-criminal-cases-still-to-come-20171025-gz7y37">ato had recouped $50 million</a> and was investigating 570 australians as a result of the <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org">panama papers</a>. \xe2\x80\x9cthe government especially funded us to get to the bottom of corporate tax avoidance. we\xe2\x80\x99ve recruited 250 people 20 contractors former partners at accounting firms and law firms very senior people [to] share their insights and knowledge. it\xe2\x80\x99s been incredible how many people have wanted to give back or perhaps felt uncertain about some of the positions they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over the years.\xe2\x80\x9d  </div></div>
