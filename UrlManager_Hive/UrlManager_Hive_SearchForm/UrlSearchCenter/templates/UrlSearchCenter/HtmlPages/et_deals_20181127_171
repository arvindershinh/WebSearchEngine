<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>kolkata: bharti group's decision to sell a 20% stake in dth arm bharti telemedia to warburg pincus for $350 million (rs 2 258 crore) will enable flagship bharti airtel fund its capital expenditure plan aimed at bolstering 4g network and combating reliance jio infocomm  analysts said.last month  the sunil mittal-led telecom market leader boosted its capex guidance for fiscal 2018 to rs 25 000 crore from the earlier rs 20 000 crore. gopal vittal  bharti airtel’s managing director for india and south asia  had said the additional capex would be deployed toward bolstering its radio network and fibre capacity as it tries to expand market share and improve customer experience amid continuing price volatility.“when pricing is low  capex is required to deliver better customer experience amid the upsurge in data throughput and demand ” vittal said during a recent earnings call.while analysts expect the proceeds from the stake sale to go primarily towards this purpose  some guess the company to use part of the money to reduce debt.“cash raised from the stake sale in the dth business to warburg pincus should enable bharti airtel to fund capex on the india wireless business ” morgan stanley said in a note seen by et.jm financial said the transaction  though not truly about value-unlocking  would help bharti airtel “marginally reduce its balance sheet leverage”. it also indicated a possible listing of the bharti group’s dth business in future.analysts at bnp paribas said the deal with warburg  though not a large one  shows “bharti can dip into its dth business  besides towers and african assets should it want to deleverage its balance sheet”.brokerage kotak securities said the stake sale would "essentially be immaterial from a net debt reduction standpoint" for bharti airtel  which would "receive $263 million  which is less than 2% of its consolidated net debt at end 2qfy18".under the deal announced on tuesday  bharti airtel will sell a 15% stake in bharti telemedia to warburg pincus  while another bharti group company that owns 5% in the dth unit will offer its entire stake to the private equity firm.kotak said the rationale of the transaction was possibly to “set a benchmark for the bharti dth arm’s valuation for a future further stake sale in the private or public markets”.morgan stanley said the stake sale valued bharti’s dth business at $1.75 billion  marginally ahead of the brokerage’s $1.65 billion estimate.bnp paribas backed the view  saying bharti’s dth business stake sale had transpired “at a significant premium to cost”. the parent company has made a $1.15 billion cumulative investment in bharti telemedia up to september 2017  it added.morgan stanley estimates bharti telemedia’s revenue and operating income (ebitda) to see a 10% and 12% compounded annual growth rate (cagr)  respectively  during fiscal 2017-20.for the financial year through march 2017  bharti’s dth unit reported gross revenue of rs 3 430.6 crore  17.6% higher from the year before.jm financial said warburg pincus  which will get a board seat in bharti telemedia  would also “benefit from likely earnings compounding and free-cash-flow generation potential in the dth sector”.bharti airtel’s shares closed 1.34% lower at rs 516.95 on the bse wednesday  compared with a 0.53% drop in the benchmark sensex.</div></div>
