<div><div><h2>The ships Glencore wanted to keep &#8216;hush hush&#8217;</h2></div><div>one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest companies went to extra lengths to keep its ties to a flotilla of commodity freighters secret. swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s fleet of giant freighters crisscrosses the seas from southern africa and south america laden with coal destined for power stations in europe and other continents. on any given day in major ports <a href="http://www.swissmarine.com/company-profile">swissmarine</a> can be difficult to miss. the hulking vessels linger in brazil panama and india for hours unloading cargo. the closely held shipper formed in 2001 and headquartered in geneva switzerland is a $1 billion to $2 billion operation that gives no public information on its owners. but through leaked files from appleby one of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/appleby-offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-of-compliance-failures-icij/">world\xe2\x80\x99s largest offshore law firms</a> it emerges that since its inception swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s most important co-owner has been <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/">glencore</a> the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest commodity trader. glencore was one appleby&#8217;s top clients. the organization at one stage even had a <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/">dedicated room in appleby&#8217;s </a>bermuda office. via its fully owned swiss subsidiary sidhalu s.a. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4178335-smc-shareholding-redaction.html">glencore owned 47.09 percent of swissmarine</a> in 2015 according to documents shared with appleby and swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s bank. other owners include swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive peter weernink; a greek ship owner victor restis and macsteel international holdings bv a steel trader based in the netherlands that is a joint venture between units of macsteel holdings luxembourg s.a.r.l. a shipping and trading concern and steel and mining giant arcelormittal south africa. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files reveal that its employees worked for years with the belief that glencore wanted its links to swissmarine hidden. the employees in bermuda took heed. \xe2\x80\x9cwe represent an entity by the name of sidhalu which is ultimately connected with glencore\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4178327-swissmarine-email.html">wrote an appleby lawyer</a> in january 2009. \xe2\x80\x9cbut the fact of and nature of this connection is extremely hush hush and we must never disclose this in any communications\xe2\x80\xa6in any way which may become public.\xe2\x80\x9d years before glencore was so unwilling to disclose its relationship with swissmarine that it decided against using the bermuda branch of banking giant hsbc to avoid that bank\xe2\x80\x99s questions about swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s true ownership. swissmarine opened an account with the bank of n.t. butterfield according to appleby emails because it would be \xe2\x80\x9cbetter and easier\xe2\x80\x9d given that butterfield\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure requirements were \xe2\x80\x9cmore reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d a reason for the secrecy is not stated in the leaked records and in response to icij questions glencore said that it did not \xe2\x80\x9cwidely disclose\xe2\x80\x9d its ownership in swissmarine \xe2\x80\x9cfor commercial reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d the shipping company was a big borrower from glencore-related units \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes at high rates. in november 2008 glencore\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiary sidhalu lent swissmarine $22.9 million as part of a $60 million loan from swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s four owners. the loan was unsecured and accrued 18 percent interest per year. on oct. 24 2014 sidhalu gave an additional loan of $9.6 million to swissmarineat an interest rate of 2 percent. glencore told icij that the \xe2\x80\x9chigh interest rate\xe2\x80\x9d on the 2008 loan to swissmarine was made during the 2008 global financial crisis. the high rate on the earlier loan is notable even given the crisis when borrowing rates spiked. but experts said the arrangement may have provided swissmarine with an uncommon cash injection through unusual if legal means at a time when the shipping industry was suffering. &#8220;it would be difficult to justify the 18% rate in any context including the november 2008 financial crisis\xe2\x80\x9d said nikos nomikos professor of shipping risk management at cass business school. in its public reports and in disclosures to the london stock exchange where it is listed glencore has never listed its connection to swissmarine despite the shipping company\xe2\x80\x99s sizeable revenue which according to a confidential swissmarine annual report shared with appleby was $1.9 billion in 2014. glencore\xe2\x80\x99s significant shareholding of swissmarine and its control over operational matters such as opening a bank account suggest that swissmarine should have been specified by name in glencore\xe2\x80\x99s recent financial statements said prem sikka emeritus professor of accounting at the university of essex. \xe2\x80\x9canything worth $2 billion seems material to me.\xe2\x80\x9d but swissmarine \xe2\x80\x9cis not a significant investment for glencore\xe2\x80\x9d the company told icij adding that any profit that goes to glencore is included in glencore\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated financial statements. glencore discloses its beneficial ownership in swissmarine \xe2\x80\x9cwhere necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to banks and tax authorities the company said. swissmarine\xe2\x80\x99s website simply says it is \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.swissmarine.com/company-profile">privately held</a>\xe2\x80\x9d and mentions glencore as a customer among many others. glencore\xe2\x80\x99s offshore lawyers too appeared somewhat in the dark. \xe2\x80\x9cnow you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned glencore\xe2\x80\x9d wrote in 2004 an appleby employee who was asked to sign documents in bermuda on behalf of swissmarine \xe2\x80\x9ci remember&#8230; an element of confidentiality attaching to this structure \xe2\x80\x93 i can\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly what it is but i know it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d</div></div>
