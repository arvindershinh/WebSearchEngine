<div><div><h2>Watch: Is this tribute to Elton John s musical career a touching tribute or a clever ad?</h2></div><div>we all know elton john as a singer whose music has inspired generations. now a new advertisement of all things offers a peek into the story of his beginnings and his rise to stardom. john is the star of the 2018 john lewis christmas campaign a mini-biopic set to his own hit from 1970 your song. starting in the present day the story of his life and musical career is presented in reverse chronological order leading up to christmas day in 1951 when he was presented with his first piano by his grandmother. the ad is a part of a campaign by the high-end department stores in the united kingdom to push pianos as christmas gifts. talking about the importance of the ad john said  it s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey i have been on and how first playing my grandmother s piano marks the moment when music came into my life. on social media however the advertisement got mixed response. many said it was only a plug for john s final farewell yellow brick road tour which kicked off in september and his biopic in 2019. i m normally a huge fan of the @jlandpartners christmas ads. this is just an ad for @eltonofficial  to co-incide with ticket pre-sales & an upcoming film! really disappointed this year   he should have paid you for this not the other way around     jo hogben   (@jmh3004) november 15 2018so the john lewis advert is just a 2 min advert for the elton john movie coming out in 2019 then yea  #rocketman #johnlewischristmasadvert  paul beebe (@paulbeebe) november 15 2018others thought it was a touching tribute. love this advert! it left me with a lump in my throat. that s what life is all about it flies by - he started as a little boy loving the piano. my little boy loves piano and it just made me realise he ll be an older man one day - make the most of every day they re young   emma smith (@_emmajune_) november 15 2018yet again @jlandpartners produce a great christmas cracker.  thank you. pic.twitter.com/omlqnwtznj  mordy (@davemordaunt) november 15 2018</div></div>
