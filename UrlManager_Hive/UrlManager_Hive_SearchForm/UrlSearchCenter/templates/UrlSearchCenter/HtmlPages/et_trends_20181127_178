<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>indian companies are conspicuous by their absence in the global research and development scene  with just tata motors breaking into the top 100 spenders on r&d; for the last fiscal year. as per bloomberg data  tata motors (standalone) figures at the 99th position globally  but on including jlr  its rank rises to an impressive 13. sun pharma is 104  mahindra & mahindra 114  lupin 120 and dr reddy’s 121 on the list dominated by american  japanese and a few chinese companies.india inc seems to be investing in r&d; only when external exigencies compel making such an investment. among the top 10 spenders in india  five are in pharma and three in automotive — industries that have been compelled to invest in r&d; due to global competition  disruption in the sectors or to comply with regulations. at over rs 19 000 crore  tata motors  including jlr  spent more than the next nine companies combined on r&d.;“indian companies have been increasing r&d; spending  though not enough”  said professor ashok jhunjhunwala  iit-madras. “we still do not have enough academia-industry interaction — part of the reason is that academia is not used to deliver what industry wants  and industry has not learnt to take what academia can provide and take it forward”  he told et. the government of india's economic survey 2017-18 has called for doubling of national expenditures on r&d.; according to the survey  india’s spending on r&d; in terms of percentage of gdp has been stagnant at 0.6-0.7% in the last two decades – much lower than the us (2.8)  china (2.1)  south korea (4.2) and israel (4.3). there is a 150% deduction of expenditure towards r&d.;are indian investors ready for companies that spend heavily on r&d;  especially  since a higher spend on r&d; can be a drag on profitability in the short term. according to nilesh shah  managing director of kotak mahindra amc  indian investors don't have the kind of bargaining power to influence the management’s decision on r&d.; “but we are enforcing the need to invest in future r&d.; to it companies  for instance  we have requested that while their promoters are investing in start-ups  why don't they invest in start-ups or new technologies  thereby using excess cash balance”  he told et. shah  however  admits that institutional investors in india do not have enough domain knowledge to ask companies to invest in innovation.to be sure  innovative r&d; is not easy – requiring sustained investment over long period of time. glenmark pharma  one of earliest indian pharma companies to invest serious money in it  is yet to launch a new chemical entity even after a decade though it has managed to earn milestone payments from its r&d.; most companies are investing in either process innovation or incremental innovation aimed to reduce the cost or improve the efficiency of the product – not necessarily creating a new product. “despite the ups and downs  we have not shied away from consistently investing 11-12% of our annual revenue towards r&d; for the past three-to-four years”  said spokesperson of glenmark pharma. “half of this is spent on innovative r&d;  which is a difficult area to crack. but we are confident that the pay day of our investments will come”.</div></div>
