<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div>one year ago icij launched the biggest investigation in journalism history: the panama papers. icij and more than 100 media partners published hundreds of stories revealing the offshore financial secrets of many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest and most powerful people. the investigation sparked protests resignations arrests and fierce debate around the world. and that was just the beginning. since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with more than 500 journalists to continue the investigation and help bring transparency to a secretive world. icij\xe2\x80\x99s staff have flown tens of thousands of miles to train reporters to address parliamentary inquiries and to continue exposing the shadowy industry of offshore finance. to cap it all off in early 2017 icij took the momentous step to spin off from the center for public integrity and become a fully-independent organization with the ambitious goal of producing the world\xe2\x80\x99s best cross-border journalism. <strong>needless to say it has been a huge year for icij!</strong> and now we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for your help to keep the momentum going. at a time when autocrats demagogues criminals and other shady characters are seeking to enrich themselves at the expense of society it is more important than ever that journalists can remain the world\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and ears and root out corruption and wrongdoing. please <a href="/donate">pledge your support for icij</a> and help us in our mission to expose wrongdoing and to hold the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful people to account.</strong></div></div>
