<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>indian executives contributed to a statistical improbability when a huge portion of those surveyed about their cyber security efforts considered their organisation as “above average or better” in cyber preparedness over competitors. in fact  indians outnumbered the global average of 76% respondents who felt their cyber security efforts were better  a survey by analytics firm fico has found. the survey was conducted by research firm ovum on behalf of fico.indian financial services and utility industry executives were found to be “least realistic” with 100% rating their firms as above average or top performers  while retail services had the highest percentage who said their firms were top performers at 60%.this — coupled with findings that 8% have no robust assessment program in place — makes the study conclude that a lack of an objective measure of cyber risk could be behind india’s overoptimistic view. “it is statistically improbable that such a high percentage of companies is better than average ” reads the report.cyber crime victims in india lost nearly $18.5 billion last year  less than china ($66.3 billion)  brazil ($22.5 billion) and the us ($19.4 billion).vishal goyal  country manager (india) at fico  said that despite an increase in the intensity of cyberattacks as the country goes digital  complacency creeps in when companies simply don’t pick up on data breaches. “it’s important to ensure regular robust assessments by bringing in analytics and other emerging tech for continuous monitoring of network infrastructure ” said goyal.with regard to risk expectations  56% of the indian respondents expect cyberattacks to rise in the coming year  42% say they’ll remain the same  and 2% expect them to drop — a trend that was in line with views from most other countries surveyed.cyber security investments in india seem to be primarily driven by expectation of increasing threat and pressure from customers along with lesser concern on privacy regulations & legal implications of a breach (16% and 14%  respectively) .the survey — conducted through telephone interviews with 500 senior executives across financial services  telecom  retail and e-commerce  and power & utilities — concluded that indian organisations seem to be realistic about overall levels of risk and expect it to increase  but are not as realistic about their own cyber security readiness.</div></div>
