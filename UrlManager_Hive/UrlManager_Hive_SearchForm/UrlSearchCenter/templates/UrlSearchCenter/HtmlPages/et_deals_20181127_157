<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>bengaluru/mumbai: taxi aggregator ola has bought foodpanda india from its german parent delivery hero group in a stock deal pegged at about $40 million  re-entering a resurgent food-delivery market that has matured and become more competitive in the past year.softbank-backed ola will also invest $200 million in foodpanda india  as it takes on rival ubereats and incumbents zomato and swiggy in one of the most-coveted and high-frequency consumer markets in india.the companies did not disclose the exact financial details of the deal  which is seen as a distress sale for the food-delivery firm. foodpanda india handles about 30 000 orders a day in about 150 cities  and ubereats india about 10 000 orders a day in seven cities  according to analysts  which would give ola  an upper hand over its primary rival through its latest acquisition  in the food-delivery business. ubereats said the estimate of 10 000 orders a day was “grossly inconsistent” with market realities but declined to disclose the average number of daily orders the platform handles.the bigger challenge for ola's food-delivery business will come from swiggy  which handles about 140 000 orders a day in india. zomato handles about 100 000 orders a day in india and the uae.saurabh kochhar  chief executive of foodpanda india  will be replaced by ola founding partner pranay jivrajka as interim ceo  the cab aggregator said in a statement.after two years of flagging business  food-delivery has once again emerged as the frontier to capture for consumer internet companies  with a wave of consolidations resurrecting hope for the sector. the food-delivery business offers one of the highest frequency rates when it comes to transaction volumes along with sizeable order values. both these metric will be crucial for ola  which shut its earlier food-delivery venture  ola cafe  in march 2016 but has continued to look at diversified offerings in a bid to outpace uber in digital transactions.“ola will eventually become an integrated services network  where ola money will be linked to not only booking cabs or paying for meals at restaurants  but also a host of other services including food-delivery and possibly a re-entry into the grocery segment in 2018 ” said an analyst  speaking anonymously.the food-delivery landscape in india has seen a 130% rise in order volumes  which is expected to touch 370 000 orders per day this year  up from about 160 000 in 2016  according to estimates from redseer consulting.“for ola  the synergy is the customer base that this acquisition gives  along with a fairly decent number of restaurants on board and some brand recall value though miniscule ” said an investor in the food-delivery space  declining to be identified. “through this deal ola will easily take on ubereats  which is failing to pick up traction for varied reasons… but whether ola can cement a significant position in the food-delivery space through foodpanda is questionable.”delivery hero has been looking to sell foodpanda india almost ever since it acquired the global foodpanda business from germany’s rocket internet in december 2016. foodpanda india had held talks with faasos and zomato for a possible merger  with delivery hero offering to invest sizeable capital in the merged business if a deal went through  according to two people aware of the discussions. however  the talks fell apart with foodpanda’s huge overhead costs making the transaction unattractive  one of them said.this year  market leader swiggy has invested aggressively to maintain its lead  while zomato and foodpanda underwent a clean-up gaining significant growth in revenues and order volumes while limiting their pace of losses.foodpanda india has been looking to trim expenses and build a robust balance sheet. the delivery firm  which works with 15 000 restaurants in india  shrunk its losses by almost 70% last year  making it a sweet purchase for ola.foodpanda india’s revenue grew 64% to rs 62.16 crore in fiscal year 2016-17  while losses fell to rs 45 crore from rs 142.6 crore  show documents filed with the registrar of companies and accessed by research platform tofler.“foodpanda has come to be a very efficient and profit-focused business over the last couple of years ” said bhavish aggarwal  ceo of ola  in a statement. “our commitment to invest $200 million in foodpanda india will help the business be focused on growth by creating value for customers and partners. with delivery hero’s global leadership and ola’s platform capabilities with unique local insights  this partnership is born out of strength.”while ola cafe  which was built with an investment of $20-30 million  did not yield significant results for the ride-hailing aggregator  analysts expect that the $200-million infusion into foodpanda india will give ola a sizeable entry in the food-delivery space this time around.</div></div>
