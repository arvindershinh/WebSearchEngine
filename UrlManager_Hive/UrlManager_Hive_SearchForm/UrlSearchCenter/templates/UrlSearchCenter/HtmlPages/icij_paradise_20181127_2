<div><div><h2>\xe2\x80\x98Offshore Magic Circle\xe2\x80\x99 Law Firm Has Record of Compliance Failures</h2></div><div>a secret stash of documents provide inside view of storied legal practice founded in bermuda. when robert woods an ex-cop from liverpool took a job in early 2006 as a compliance manager for appleby the global offshore law firm he joined an organization that had problems. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s cayman islands office where he worked for example had more than 600 clients on its books whose records were labeled \xe2\x80\x9cnon-compliant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that the firm had no current ids contact information or other particulars needed to make sure it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t setting up shell companies and other structures for criminals or corrupt politicians. five years later woods had moved up in the firm taking over as its director of compliance. but things hadn\xe2\x80\x99t improved much \xe2\x80\x93 at least according to a powerpoint presentation he appears to have put together sometime near the end of 2011. the 44-page training slideshow which featured images from the hbo mafia drama \xe2\x80\x9cthe sopranos\xe2\x80\x9d recalled lowlights of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s recent history. under a slide titled \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist financing offences\xe2\x80\x9d the notes read: \xe2\x80\x9cwe have a current case where we are sitting on about 400k that is definitely tainted and it is not easy to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d in another case woods\xe2\x80\x99 notes indicated appleby set up a trust for a client to buy property in london and accepted money on his behalf \xe2\x80\x9cwithout question.\xe2\x80\x9d appleby later learned the presentation acknowledged that the trust was owned by a former pakistani official who had been charged with embezzling public money and had \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrated allegedly corrupt funds into our business.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csome of the crap we accept is amazing totally amazing\xe2\x80\x9d the presentation\xe2\x80\x99s notes said beneath a slide listing the information appleby employees needed to know about its clients. a <a href="http://icij.org/paradisepapers">leak of 6.8 million confidential records</a> reveals among other things how appleby has sometimes failed to keep out questionable clients \xe2\x80\x93 before woods\xe2\x80\x99 2011 powerpoint and since then. the documents expose the secret offshore lives of politicians and fraudsters and elaborate tax- avoidance strategies pursued by apple <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/nike-stays-ahead-regulators/">nike</a> and other corporate giants. the emails client records bank applications court papers and other files were obtained by the german newspaper <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de">s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung</a> and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and other media organizations. they represent the inner workings of appleby from the 1950s until 2016. the files include documents from the firm&#8217;s corporate services division which became independent in 2016 under the name estera. appleby did not provide icij with answers to detailed questions. instead it <a href="http://www.applebyglobal.com/news/news-2017/media-coverage-of-the-offshore-sector.aspx">released a media statement online</a> that said the firm is committed to high standards. following a thorough and vigorous investigation appleby said it rejects any allegations of wrongdoing by the company or its clients.\xc2\xa0estera did not respond to questions. appleby said: \xe2\x80\x9cwe are an offshore law firm who advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business. we do not tolerate illegal behavior. it is true that we are not infallible. where we find that mistakes have happened we act quickly to put things right and we make the necessary notifications to the relevant authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d appleby which was founded in bermuda is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious offshore law firms. although appleby is not a tax adviser the 119-year-old firm is a leading member of the global network of lawyers accountants bankers and other operatives who set up and manage offshore companies and bank accounts for clients who want to avoid taxes or keep their finances under wraps. along with helping to set up shell companies trusts and other offshore entities the firm has various subsidiaries affiliates and business units that draft wills represent clients involved in litigation over workplace accidents or divorce and advise corporations. north americans account for the biggest part of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s workload; the firm has worked for residents of all 50 u.s. states. appleby sees itself as an industry leader proving to the world that the offshore industry can operate cleanly and professionally. \xe2\x80\x9cwe provide innovative timely and ethical advice\xe2\x80\x9d the firm advertises in its eight-page brochure. over cocktails at working dinners and around conference tables it meets with representatives of major clients many of which are leading banks and accounting firms such as kpmg ernst &  young and pricewaterhousecoopers. in the cayman islands half of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s top 20 clients in 2014 were major banks and investment firms including citigroup bank of america hsbc credit suisse and wells fargo. when icij and its media partners began publishing the <a href="http://panamapapers.icij.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panama papers investigation</a> in april 2016 offshore promoters downplayed its significance. they said mossack fonseca the panama-headquartered law firm at the center of the scandal was an outlier. \xe2\x80\x9cmossack fonseca represents one of the last bastions of a shadowy international financial system that is rapidly ceasing to exist\xe2\x80\x9d the <a href="http://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/what-do-panama-papers-mean-offshore-wealth-management">trade magazine wealth management</a> reported. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s internal files show however that that even when offshore law firms invest large amounts of money and effort to stay compliant and reputable the secrecy and the lure of financial gain at the heart of the shadow economy make it difficult for offshore operatives to avoid doing business with criminals corrupt politicians and other questionable clients. &#8220;money laundering is a dirty crime&#8221; screamed the notes to woods\xe2\x80\x99 2011 powerpoint presentation appearing in all caps for emphasis. &#8220;there is usually always a victim at the bottom of the pile and a rich person at the top.&#8221; woods who is still appleby\xe2\x80\x99s director of compliance declined to comment when icij asked him whether in his view the firm had improved its client-screening practices since 2011. the presentation is one of at least four powerpoint offerings drafted by appleby\xe2\x80\x99s compliance team between 2007 and 2015 that raised questions about how well the firm checked out its clients. it is unclear whether these presentations were made before appleby employees. but in each of them speaker\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the bottom of the slides provide unguarded commentary from insiders about appleby\xe2\x80\x99s compliance fumbles. \xe2\x80\x9ceighty percent of the battle is won or lost at the gate\xe2\x80\x9d read the text with a slide used repeatedly in appleby compliance presentations. \xe2\x80\x9cif we let in the wrong clients we set ourselves up for a fall.\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="http://www.bermuda-online.org/history1939-1951.htm">appleby was born in 1898</a> in the british colony of bermuda as the private practice of maj. reginald woodifield appleby a tea-drinking cricket-playing rifle-shooting magistrate who became a member of the island\xe2\x80\x99s parliament and was knighted \xe2\x80\x9cfor public services in bermuda.\xe2\x80\x9d such was his status that when a vacationing major appleby sailed to england in 1924 the royal gazette &  colonist daily predicted a rise in crime during his absence. when bermuda\xe2\x80\x99s legislature met in july 1940 to debate the island\xe2\x80\x99s first income tax major appleby spoke out aligning himself with \xe2\x80\x9cthose who look on all income tax as man\xe2\x80\x99s last refinement of torture to be resisted at all costs\xe2\x80\x9d reported the royal gazette. bermuda has never looked back; it continues to entice locals and foreigners with a zero tax rate. since expanding outside bermuda in 1979 appleby has transformed itself into a global institution with more than 700 employees spread across nearly every major tax haven \xe2\x80\x93 from the cayman islands in the caribbean to the isle of man in europe mauritius in africa and hong kong in asia. \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem like a monster \xe2\x80\x93 which is a good thing!\xe2\x80\x9d one appleby client responded in a 2013 satisfaction survey. appleby collects \xe2\x80\x9coffshore law firm of the year\xe2\x80\x9d awards and is cited as part of what insiders call the \xe2\x80\x9coffshore magic circle\xe2\x80\x9d an informal collection of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest offshore law firms which jostle for the same business. former employees serve as members of parliament judges and other government officials and at least one low-tax jurisdiction the cook islands used appleby\xe2\x80\x99s expertise to draw up its own offshore laws. publicly the firm has burnished its image by sponsoring the america\xe2\x80\x99s cup 5k family runs and cake sales. in advertising material appleby vaunts its benevolent undertakings including working to help nigeria recover money from the family of former dictator sani abacha and administering a multimillion-dollar fund to support nurses treating ebola patients in west africa. its clients include princesses prime ministers and hollywood stars. appleby has worked for some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest oligarchs from russia the middle east asia and africa. in the firm\xe2\x80\x99s bermuda office more than one in 10 companies had ties to clients with political connections including politicians their families or their close associates according to an internal memo. many of the highest-profile clients were managed by separate appleby teams of trust specialists. in april 2016 appleby announced the launch of estera formerly the firm\xe2\x80\x99s profitable fiduciary arm which manages the companies trusts jets and other assets of the global elite. appleby and the new company remain close; some former appleby employees now work for estera from the same office address they occupied before. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s recipe for success appears to have worked for the firm and its customers. appleby books more than $100 million a year in revenue. clients tell the firm that they find it \xe2\x80\x9chard-working\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfriendly.\xe2\x80\x9d one happy fee-payer told appleby that its \xe2\x80\x9cbrand is a bit like being stranded in the middle of africa and seeing a ba [british airways] plane land \xe2\x80\x93 you know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get out of there.\xe2\x80\x9d appleby shares its customers\xe2\x80\x99 confidence. days after last year\xe2\x80\x99s publication of the panama papers appleby turned down an offer from a risk consulting firm of a \xe2\x80\x9crefresher\xe2\x80\x9d training course on preventing money laundering. the law firm declined explaining that it has \xe2\x80\x9cextremely robust\xe2\x80\x9d controls in place. \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t have the need for your sessions this time round.\xe2\x80\x9d on june 29 1993 with memories of the persian gulf war still fresh a u.s. house subcommittee convened to discuss iraq\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program. iraq had breached an agreement to allow united nations inspectors to examine the country\xe2\x80\x99s uranium stockpile and international concerns were high. \xe2\x80\x9ciraq continues to flaunt its military power massacring its own citizens in the north and iraqi shiites in the south\xe2\x80\x9d rep. tom lantos democrat of california said in opening remarks just after 10 a.m. that day. lantos read into the record a report from the subcommittee staff. among its findings was that crescent petroleum a major private oil company was being investigated by u.s. authorities to determine whether it was a \xe2\x80\x9cfront company\xe2\x80\x9d for iraqi president saddam hussein. even if crescent wasn\xe2\x80\x99t manufacturing weapons itself the report stated \xe2\x80\x9cit was certainly linked to the principal iraqi organization that was.\xe2\x80\x9d crescent then as now denied wrongdoing. the june 29 hearing was broadcast live in the united states. but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have been noticed by appleby\xe2\x80\x99s office in bermuda. crescent petroleum owned by hamid jafar had been an appleby client since 1984. for nearly 30 years appleby\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with crescent proceeded smoothly according to the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s files. it was only after appleby was asked to help restructure crescent in 2013 that the firm appeared to notice jafar\xe2\x80\x99s background \xe2\x80\x93 including that his brother had headed iraq\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program under saddam hussein. \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had this relationship for some time now\xe2\x80\x9d one appleby lawyer wrote. \xe2\x80\x9chow can we not have known this earlier \xe2\x80\x9d while rules and regulations vary in many of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s busiest offices great chunks of its work are governed by rules that require offshore providers to keep accurate records on who is using their services for what purposes and where the money comes from. another client who appeared to fall through the cracks was ehud arye laniado director and co-owner of omega diamonds a belgian company operating on the antwerp diamond exchange. in may 2013 belgian news media reported that omega diamonds had agreed to pay about $200 million to settle allegations that the company had <span style="font-weight: 400;">had not declared income from</span> african diamonds. omega did not admit liability and the case did not involve laniado personally. months later appleby accepted two payments from laniado worth $5000 and the money was placed in the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s bank account on behalf of an offshore trust. later when laniado wanted to create a new trust an appleby employee noted news reports about omega diamonds\xe2\x80\x99 legal problems but cleared the law firm to do business with him. appleby created the new trust for him in april 2014. woods appleby\xe2\x80\x99s compliance director was upset when he found out about laniado three months later. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a trust structure and the allegations are extremely serious and relate to blood diamonds\xe2\x80\x9d woods wrote to a colleague in july 2014. \xe2\x80\x9cwhy was this not brought to my attention before the conflict check was cleared  \xe2\x80\x9d despite woods\xe2\x80\x99 concerns appleby kept laniado as client. woods agreed that although laniado was \xe2\x80\x9chigh risk (due to involvement in the diamond industry) we have enough mitigating factors and information to be comfortable with the business; in fact it should be a good piece of business all around.\xe2\x80\x9d but he told his colleagues that the episode represented a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure of our processes.\xe2\x80\x9d he warned that the firm\xe2\x80\x99s business units such as appleby trust (cayman) ltd. shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the quest for short-term profits overshadow the need to follow rules that required appleby to assess the risks laniado posed and to know who he was and what he wanted to do offshore. \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s done is done but going forward whilst being commercial please let us try to ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get carried away with fee earning potential\xe2\x80\x9d woods wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cthe law firm must be cognisant of the fact that whilst they may be \xe2\x80\x98raking in the fees\xe2\x80\x99 the trust company carries the significant risk in administering the subsequent structure. the trust co. must be aware that at the end of the day if it all goes wrong they will be left holding the \xe2\x80\x98steaming turd\xe2\x80\x99! (it is friday and holding the bag did not sound strong enough!)\xe2\x80\x9d appleby was still acting as trustee for the laniado\xe2\x80\x99s trust as of early 2016 the firm\xe2\x80\x99s internal records show. woods and appleby did not respond to specific requests for comment. laniado\xe2\x80\x99s legal counsel substantively responded to icij on his behalf but requested the contents of the response not be published. laniado has previously stated that he has never had any involvement with blood diamonds. in day-to-day operations appleby uses software designed to reduce human error and identify risky clients. the firm\xe2\x80\x99s manual requires employees to screen potential clients with a thorough online search and update records on anyone connected to politics once every year. the firm and its subsidiaries have carried out internal audits kept spreadsheets on what it called \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d companies and produced \xe2\x80\x9cyellow cards\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that company information was accurate. the controls worked for example when appleby\xe2\x80\x99s office in the british virgin islands rejected business involving boris shemyakin a russian real estate mogul after online background checks showed that he had been indicted in russia on charges involving a multibillion-dollar fraud. he denies wrongdoing. the law firm also declined work with the global accounting firm ernst &  young when it approached appleby for possible help with the purchase of two $20 million gulfstream jets for two sons of a former government minister in azerbaijan and a man named manouchehr khangah. appleby checked the wikileaks database of u.s. diplomatic cables and learned that one of the u.s. embassy\xe2\x80\x99s contacts referred to khangah as the \xe2\x80\x9cfrontman\xe2\x80\x9d for a former politician who headed what the u.s. cables called \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most corrupt operations in azerbaijan.\xe2\x80\x9d appleby declined the work. khangah could not be reached for comment. ernst &  young said it could not comment on individual matters but that it is \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to financial legal and regulatory compliance in all of its work.\xe2\x80\x9d appleby knew the risks. slap-bang in the center of a powerpoint slide prepared for a 2012 training session in bermuda was a gray headstone bearing the name \xe2\x80\x9carthur andersen\xe2\x80\x9d a reference to the audit firm convicted of obstruction of justice in 2002 for having destroyed documents relating to an investigation into the collapse of the energy giant enron. the supreme court overturned the conviction but the firm was unable to recover. if appleby didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a better job of monitoring clients the presentation suggested employees could find themselves caught up in high-profile financial scandals like david duncan the former andersen auditor who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and hedge fund manager<a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/billionaire-hedge-fund-founder-arrested-for-insider-trading-64518027.html">\xc2\xa0raj rajaratnam who was pictured in handcuffs</a> as fbi agents arrested him for a multimillion-dollar securities fraud case. he was later convicted. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are exposed\xe2\x80\x9d the slide show warned. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not the best we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d between 2005 and 2015 more than a dozen internal and regulatory examinations of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s offices in the isle of man the cayman islands the british virgin islands bermuda and london found flaws that could have involved appleby in litigation and had financial and reputation implications.. after a 2005 review by a regulatory agency the bermuda monetary authority appleby\xe2\x80\x99s trust company was ordered to improve 21 deficiencies in its performance and to obtain fresh accurate records of its clients\xe2\x80\x99 passports addresses and sources of wealth. later despite improvements appleby\xe2\x80\x99s head of compliance then ian patrick wrote \xe2\x80\x9ci still believe that a huge effort will be required before we can be considered to be an offshore leader from a compliance perspective.\xe2\x80\x9d the next year an internal audit by patrick at the british virgin islands office looked at 45 client files and found that only one of them met appleby\xe2\x80\x99s standards. of the five appleby offices reviewed around that time patrick reported that only the hong kong office kept its documents \xe2\x80\x9cin good order.\xe2\x80\x9d an internal audit of the cayman islands\xe2\x80\x99 trust office in 2008 found the risk of breaking laws and appleby\xe2\x80\x99s own protocols to be \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d in more than half of all the categories under review. the audit report noted a risk of fraudulent activities and said appleby \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be complying\xe2\x80\x9d with the law. a 2012 review by regulators in the british virgin islands found holes in appleby\xe2\x80\x99s procedures for dealing with high-risk politicians and associates. an internal 2015 spot-check of the isle of man office revealed other problems including one offshore company co-owned by a palestinian official for which appleby\xe2\x80\x99s lacked detailed information about an $11.2 million loan. when the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164952-bermuda-audit-2015-page-1-and-2.html">bermuda monetary authority audited an appleby subsidiary</a> in october 2014 it found \xe2\x80\x9ckey or highly significant\xe2\x80\x9d weaknesses in nine areas. nearly half \xe2\x80\x93 46 percent \xe2\x80\x93 of the files reviewed by the agency lacked information on the origin of the money appleby managed for its clients. there was \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that appleby identified risks of money laundering and terrorism financing the agency said and the firm had not adopted the recommendations from previous audits. \xe2\x80\x9cthese omissions have heightened the authority\xe2\x80\x99s concern about the firm\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory compliance and control environment\xe2\x80\x9d the agency said. in october 2015 an appleby director disclosed in a confidential document to government regulators in the british virgin islands that the bermuda office had \xe2\x80\x9csettled\xe2\x80\x9d a fine imposed by bermuda regulators after it conceded that it had failed to follow up on many of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for fixing weaknesses in its anti-money-laundering net. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s internal records show that the firm set aside $500000 for the fine but its existence has never been publicly disclosed. there was \xe2\x80\x9cno public censure\xe2\x80\x9d the director wrote adding that bermuda\xe2\x80\x99s regulators \xe2\x80\x9cagreed to keep the matter entirely private.\xe2\x80\x9d a spokesman for the bermuda monetary authority told icij that it would not confirm or deny enforcement decisions. in 2016 the spokesman said the authority changed its policy and now publishes details of fines and other sanctions online. \xe2\x80\x9cwe are subject to frequent regulatory checks and we are committed to achieving the high standards set by our regulators\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="http://www.applebyglobal.com/news/news-2017/media-coverage-of-the-offshore-sector.aspx">appleby stated in a press release</a> published one month after first receiving icij\xe2\x80\x99s

ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com& ">cannon became the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit in canada</a> on behalf of almost 10000 investors including nurses teachers and lawyers who had paid more than $100 million into the program. they had lost millions they claimed by the time canada\xe2\x80\x99s tax office ruled the scheme invalid. the far-reaching legal action sought compensation from the promoters lawyers and advisers involved. one defendant was edward furtak the so-called mastermind of the charity program. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s bermuda office was another. lawyers for the investors alleged that appleby helped transfer hundreds of millions of dollars back and forth in a \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.thetorontolawyers.ca/pdfs/endorsement-strathy-july1610.pdf">circular flow of funds</a>\xe2\x80\x9d that netted furtak and his family $20 million. the investors\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers asserted that \xe2\x80\x9ca monkey covering his eyes and ears may not have foreseen\xe2\x80\x9d the risks to canadian investors but that appleby had no such excuse. in 2010 a judge found that there was a good case that appleby had harmed people in canada. justice strathy wrote that appleby \xe2\x80\x9csimply did what furtak\xe2\x80\x9d wanted it to do despite its obligations to know where money came from and how it was used. furtak was a long-standing appleby client. appleby had lent him $2.6 million to buy property on a verdant peninsula in costa rica and helped administer at least three offshore trusts for him along with a 34-meter jamaican-flagged yacht named takapuna and worth at least $5 million. the class action against furtak was settled at an early stage and furtak denied wrongdoing. the tax program was designed in compliance with the law and furtak continues to believe in its propriety his lawyers told icij. the court case against appleby rumbled on after furtak settled. in 2013 appleby\xe2\x80\x99s external lawyers told the firm\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors that the firm\xe2\x80\x99s role in the affair had been \xe2\x80\x9cfairly limited but relatively significant.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthere is some concern\xe2\x80\x9d the confidential board minutes noted that the bermuda office \xe2\x80\x9cappears to have affected the various transfers in what has been described as an unquestioning manner.\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyers warned that appleby could be found liable of enriching itself at the investors\xe2\x80\x99 expense. in the courtroom appleby defended its behavior and promised to appeal any judgment against it to the highest court it could. privately appleby had feared a penalty as high as $28.5 million documents show. at one stage an appleby employee said that one strategy was \xe2\x80\x9cto wait this out in the hope that the plaintiffs could run out of gas.\xe2\x80\x9d cannon didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up and appleby settled the case in may 2017 for $12.7 million without admitting wrongdoing. the cost may be more than financial. behind the scenes some people at appleby worried that it would take \xe2\x80\x9ca really long time\xe2\x80\x9d for the firm to absorb the financial and reputational impacts of the case. any employee with a copy of the powerpoint presentations prepared years before by appleby\xe2\x80\x99s compliance team might have found it a good time to look back at this warning: \xe2\x80\x9cevery new investigation that reveals an offshore trustee as a puppet on strings controlled by a criminal\xe2\x80\x9d will be another \xe2\x80\x9cnail in the industry\xe2\x80\x99s coffin.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>correction: this story was first
