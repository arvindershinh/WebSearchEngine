<div><div><h2>-</h2></div><div>u.s. commerce secretary wilbur l. ross jr. has a stake in a shipping firm that receives millions of dollars a year in revenue from a company whose key owners include russian president vladimir putin\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law and a russian tycoon sanctioned by the u.s. treasury department as a member of putin\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle. ross a billionaire private equity investor divested most of his business assets before joining president donald trump\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet in february but he kept a stake in the shipping firm navigator holdings ltd. which is incorporated in the marshall islands in the south pacific. offshore entities in which ross and other investors hold a financial stake controlled 31.5 percent of the company in 2016 according to navigator\xe2\x80\x99s latest annual report. among navigator\xe2\x80\x99s largest customers contributing more than $68 million in revenue since 2014 is the moscow-based gas and petrochemicals company sibur. two of its key owners are kirill shamalov who is married to putin\xe2\x80\x99s youngest daughter and gennady timchenko the sanctioned oligarch whose activities in the energy sector the treasury department said were \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly linked to putin.\xe2\x80\x9d another powerful owner is sibur\xe2\x80\x99s largest shareholder leonid mikhelson who controls an energy company that was also sanctioned by the treasury department for propping up putin\xe2\x80\x99s rule. as commerce secretary ross has direct authority over trade and manufacturing policy and is an influential voice in the government on virtually any aspect of the u.s. economic relationship with other countries including russia. in recent years tensions between the united states and russia have escalated with the united states imposing sanctions against russia after its 2014 invasion of crimea and its interference in the 2016 presidential election. <iframe src="https://projects.icij.org/paradise-papers/the-influencers/#/wilbur-ross" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> in the aftermath of the election investigations by congress and the u.s. justice department have explored potential business ties between russia and members of the trump administration. while several of trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and business associates have come under scrutiny until now no business connections have been reported between senior trump administration officials and members of putin\xe2\x80\x99s family or inner circle. during his confirmation process ross was asked repeatedly about his business ties to russia mostly related to his former role as vice chairman of the bank of cyprus which has a long history of financing russian oligarchs. &#8220;the united states senate and the american public deserve to know the full extent of your connections with russia and your knowledge of any ties between the trump administration trump campaign or trump organization and the bank of cyprus&#8221; a group of five democratic senators wrote ross after the hearing but prior to his confirmation. ross responded briefly to a question submitted for the hearing saying the russians who invested in the bank \xe2\x80\x9cwere not my partners\xe2\x80\x9d but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to the senators\xe2\x80\x99 letter. he was also asked about his shipping holdings and whether they could pose a conflict of interest with his duties at commerce. but he faced no questions about navigator \xe2\x80\x93 where his private equity firm was once the majority shareholder and ross was a member of the board \xe2\x80\x93 and its relationship with sibur. sibur is \xe2\x80\x9ca company with crony connections\xe2\x80\x9d said daniel fried a russia expert who served in senior state department posts in both republican and democratic administrations. \xe2\x80\x9cwhy would any officer of the u.s. government have any relationship with a putin crony \xe2\x80\x9d ross joined the board only after navigator began dealing with sibur and \xe2\x80\x9cnever met\xe2\x80\x9d shamalov timchenko or mikhelson said james rockas a spokesman for the commerce department. \xe2\x80\x9csecretary ross recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels but has been generally supportive of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions of russian and venezuelan entities\xe2\x80\x9d rockas said. another of navigator\xe2\x80\x99s major customers is pdvsa the venezuelan state-owned oil company controlled by the authoritarian regime of nicolas maduro. the trump administration sanctioned one current and one former executive at pdvsa in july 2017 and sanctioned the company itself the next month. the commerce secretary\xe2\x80\x99s indirect business connection with putin\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law and oligarch allies emerges from an <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/paradise-papers-exposes-donald-trump-russia-links-and-piggy-banks-of-the-wealthiest-1-percent/">examination of public records</a> and a leak of millions of offshore financial documents from the bermuda law firm appleby obtained by german newspaper s\xc3\xbcddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists and its global network of media partners. they represent the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/offshore-magic-circle-law-firm-record-compliance-failures/">inner workings of appleby</a> from the 1950s until 2016. the files include documents from appleby\xe2\x80\x99s corporate services division which became independent in 2016 under the name estera. the leaked files showed a chain of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164166-email-ownership.html">companies and partnerships</a> in the cayman islands through which ross has retained his financial stake in navigator. the fact that ross\xe2\x80\x99 cayman islands companies benefit from a firm controlled by putin proxies raises serious potential conflicts of interest experts say. as commerce secretary ross has the power to influence u.s. trade sanctions and other matters that could affect sibur\xe2\x80\x99s owners. likewise sibur\xe2\x80\x99s owners and through them putin himself could have the ability to increase or decrease sibur\xe2\x80\x99s business with navigator even as ross helps steer u.s. policy. richard painter who served as chief ethics lawyer during the george w. bush administration said ross might have to recuse himself from a range of sanctions decisions. he added that while there was no inherent violation in ross\xe2\x80\x99 holdings the navigator arrangement warrants closer scrutiny. commerce spokesman rockas said that ross \xe2\x80\x9chas never had to seek nor received any ethics exemption\xe2\x80\x9d and abides by the \xe2\x80\x9chighest ethical standards.\xe2\x80\x9d ethics exemptions are granted to allow officials to participate in issues where there might be a conflict of interest. \xe2\x80\x9capart from those legal issues i\xe2\x80\x99d be very concerned that someone in the u.s. government was making money from dealing with the russians and i\xe2\x80\x99d want to know the facts\xe2\x80\x9d painter said. before joining the trump cabinet the 79-year-old ross was a titan in the world of private equity rounding up investors from around the world to put money into troubled companies in the hope of profitably turning them around. when all went well he and his firm made money not only on their investments and management fees but also from a compensation system that allows the general partners who manage private equity funds to earn 20 percent of any profits that exceed a certain level. many of the private equity funds involved in these investments were created and administered by appleby an offshore law firm founded in bermuda . the leaked files offer a window into how appleby helped his firm wl ross &  co. llc reap the benefits of offshore havens such as the cayman islands a british territory that permits extraordinary levels of financial secrecy and allows paper companies run from new york and elsewhere to operate there tax-free. in 2015 the cayman islands was ranked fifth by the financial secrecy index in its worldwide ratings. creating offshore funds organized as corporations can be a major draw for certain investors by allowing u.s. tax-exempt organizations \xe2\x80\x93 including huge pension funds and richly endowed universities \xe2\x80\x93 to sidestep an internal revenue service rule the requires them to pay taxes on income obtained using borrowed money. they also help attract non-u.s. investors because their names aren\xe2\x80\x99t disclosed to tax authorities in the united states. general partners in offshore private equity enjoy generous tax breaks in the united states as well including the ability to count the biggest share of their earnings from the fund as a long-term capital gain rather than ordinary income. this allows the wealthiest fund managers to reduce the tax on these earnings from the top u.s. rate of 39.6 percent to 20 percent. when he was nominated as commerce secretary ross filed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164187-ross-wilbur-l-finalamendedea.html">an agreement</a> with the federal office of government ethics that said he intended to divest 80 companies and partnerships but would keep a stake in nine others that held assets in \xe2\x80\x9creal estate financing and mortgage lending\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctransoceanic shipping.\xe2\x80\x9d the assets were not specified. even though he had sold wl ross &  co. to invesco in 2006 he remained active as chair and ceo until resigning to join the cabinet. his <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164192-ross-wilbur-l-final-278.html">financial disclosure form</a> also filed with the office of government ethics runs 57 pages and includes a long list under the heading \xe2\x80\x9cemployment assets &  income and retirement accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d this list is broken down into sections listing assets that appear to be held by each of ross\xe2\x80\x99 companies detailing as many as seven layers of entities between ross and the assets he holds. buried in a multitude of subsections appear four cryptically named cayman islands entities that are among those he said he was keeping: wlr recovery associates iv dss aiv gp; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4163293-2014-annual-return.html">wlr recovery associates iv dss aiv lp</a>; wlr recovery associates v dss aiv gp and wlr recovery associates v dss aiv lp. all four companies are administered by the appleby law firm. \xe2\x80\x9cnavigator holdings\xe2\x80\x9d is listed among the assets these companies held but consistent with the format of the disclosure form no details about the company or its relationship with sibur are provided. the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4163292-offshore-structure-of-the-wl-ross-group.html">complexity of the offshore structures</a> adds legal and reputational distance and obscures the full extent of ross\xe2\x80\x99s business relationships even as it allows him to profit from them according to tax and ethics experts consulted by icij. ross\xe2\x80\x99 disclosure values his combined current stake in the offshore entities that hold navigator shares at between $2.05 million to $10.1 million. but it is not certain what his total holdings are because he did not list a value for one of the four entities he retained. it is not apparent why or whether a value was omitted. his share represents a fraction of the entities\xe2\x80\x99 overall 31.5 percent stake in navigator which based on the firm\xe2\x80\x99s stock price on oct. 30 2017 is worth roughly $179 million. the value of ross\xe2\x80\x99 investment could change substantially by the time the funds that hold navigator shares wind up \xe2\x80\x93 and holds a significant upside. if the funds performs well enough the general partnerships in which he is invested stand to receive 20 percent of the entire funds\xe2\x80\x99 profits. in addition ross has reported billions in assets to forbes magazine that did not appear on his government disclosure forms which he later told the magazine he had placed in trusts that benefit his family members. \xe2\x80\x9cthe disclosure requirements weren\xe2\x80\x99t written with wilbur ross in mind\xe2\x80\x9d said kathleen clark a law professor at washington university in st. louis and an expert on government ethics \xe2\x80\x9cand i don\xe2\x80\x99t think adequately provide the public or a government ethics official with an understanding of the wide variety of financial interests that he has.\xe2\x80\x9d ross started investing in navigator in 2011 when wl ross &  co. acquired a 19.4 percent stake and his firm was granted two seats on navigator\xe2\x80\x99s board one of which ross filled himself early the next year. a few months later with a bankruptcy court judge\xe2\x80\x99s approval wl ross acquired a block of shares from the bankrupt financial services firm lehman brothers becoming navigator\xe2\x80\x99s majority shareholder. in november 2013 navigator went public. shares that wl ross had bought for about $8 each were put on the market at $19. afterward ross bragged at a conference for shipping investors that the investment had been \xe2\x80\x9ca home run.\xe2\x80\x9d ross stepped down from navigator\xe2\x80\x99s board in november 2014 after he became vice chairman of the struggling bank of cyprus which was well known for its dealings with russian oligarchs. his navigator board seat was taken by wendy teramoto managing director and partner of wl ross &  co. who left in 2017 to become ross\xe2\x80\x99 chief of staff at the commerce department. in early 2012 not long after ross made his initial investment navigator struck up a relationship with sibur which exclusively chartered two liquified petroleum gas carriers to transport its growing lpg exports to europe. like many russian energy companies sibur was created by the russian state. founded in 1995 the firm produces petrochemical products including lpg which contains propane and butane and is used for heating appliances cooking equipment and some motor vehicles. sibur was bought several years later by the state-controlled gas company gazprom.in 2010 gazprom sold sibur to timchenko and mikhelson. amos hochstein the top u.s. energy diplomat during the obama administration said mikhelson and timchenko\xe2\x80\x99s trajectories were typical of russian energy moguls who have grown rich as a result of the public corruption and crony capitalism that are hallmarks of putin\xe2\x80\x99s long rule. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not john d. rockefeller here\xe2\x80\x9d hochstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cthey became close to putin loyal to putin got state assets and got rich.\xe2\x80\x9d the russian government continues to favor sibur. in 2013 sibur\xe2\x80\x99s export terminal in ust-luga the baltic port where navigator ships pick up lpg exports was completed as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the federal program for development of port capacities\xe2\x80\x9d according to a sibur press release. after russia\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of the ukrainian region of crimea and afterwards the united states and other western nations imposed economic sanctions on key putin allies including sibur\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest shareholder timchenko. a few months later the united states barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to sibur\xe2\x80\x99s largest shareholder mikhelson. sibur itself was not targeted but western banks including bank of america and the royal bank of scotland backed away from making loans to the company according to news reports. the russian government again stepped in to help. in may 2014 a consortium led by a state-run bank affiliated with gazprom and a state investment fund bought the ust-luga terminal from sibur and pledged to expand export capacity while allowing sibur to remain the terminal\xe2\x80\x99s sole exporter of lpg. in september 2014 with sanctions pressure growing timchenko sold a 17 percent stake in sibur to shamalov then 32 increasing putin\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s stake to more than 20 percent of the company. the purchase by shamalov was financed by a $1.3 billion loan from state-owned gazprombank. shamalov later sold part of his stake to other investors reducing his interest to 3.9 percent by april 2017 but remaining on sibur\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors. shamalov\xe2\x80\x99s profit or loss on the transactions could not be determined. \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you start doing business with russian energy companies like gazprom and sibur you\xe2\x80\x99re not just getting into bed with the company\xe2\x80\x9d said hochstein the former state department energy policy coordinator. \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re getting into bed with the russian state.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 appleby dropped mikhelson as a client declining to manage a company for his private jet because of the sanctions against his businesses according to the leaked records. despite the turmoil the navigator-sibur relationship continued to grow. from 2014 to 2015 the shipper\xe2\x80\x99s revenue from sibur jumped from 5.3 percent ($16.2 million) to 9.1 percent ($28.7 million) of total revenue making the company one of navigator\xe2\x80\x99s top five clients according to filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission before sliding down to 7.9 percent ($23.2 million) of revenue last year. this year navigator doubled the fleet dedicated to sibur exports acquiring two new vessels chartered by the russian energy company. the ships were named navigator luga and navigator yauza after russian rivers. in a conference call with investors in 2016 navigator ceo david butters said his company benefited as sibur made inroads into the european energy market over american competitors. \xe2\x80\x9crussia is pipelining as much natural gas as needed into europe and liquids are being shipped into all areas of the continent in increasing amounts all in competition with longer haul u.s. exports\xe2\x80\x9d butters said. ross \xe2\x80\x9chas repeatedly spoken in favor of increasing u.s. exports as the best way to reduce the trade deficit creating american jobs\xe2\x80\x9d said the commerce department spokesman. butters declined to comment for the story. in an emailed statement sibur said that its business partners performed \xe2\x80\x9call necessary checks\xe2\x80\x9d after the united states and other nations sanctioned russia in 2014 and that no restrictions on cooperation were identified. on nov. 30 2016 hours after being nominated as commerce secretary ross celebrated at gramercy tavern an upscale manhattan restaurant an event hosted by navigator holdings. according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-26/wilbur-ross-and-the-cabinet-of-billionaires">bloomberg businessweek</a> he and butters arrived early at the chandeliered private room and had a conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cyour interest is aligned to mine\xe2\x80\x9d butters recalled ross saying according to bloomberg. \xe2\x80\x9cthe u.s. economy will grow and navigator will be a beneficiary.\xe2\x80\x9d butters told bloomberg that as other guests arrived and tucked into sherry-sauce sea bass and pear buckle they took turns congratulating ross. \xe2\x80\x9cit was like \xe2\x80\x93 we have a chance now\xe2\x80\x9d butters told bloomberg. \xe2\x80\x9cwe have a chance to make some differences.\xe2\x80\x9d the son of a lawyer-turned-judge and a schoolteacher ross was raised in suburban new jersey and graduated from yale and harvard business school. in the late 1970s he joined the british investment banking firm rothschild group eventually rising to lead the firm\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy advisory practice. he met donald trump in 1990 when the future president\xe2\x80\x99s taj mahal casino in atlantic city was experiencing financial trouble and ross represented a group of bondholders. ross engineered a deal that preserved a stake in the company for trump reportedly telling disgruntled bondholders that the trump name was \xe2\x80\x9cstill very much an asset.\xe2\x80\x9d it was a welcome assist for the future president. in the 1990s president bill clinton appointed ross to the board of the u.s.-russia investment fund established by the government to make investments and promote american business interests in russia. in 2000 ross founded wl ross &  co. llc a new york-based private equity firm that assembles money from investors into funds that invest in struggling companies with the goal of turning them around and selling them for a profit. the new firm quickly thrived. it engineered the purchase of bankrupt american steel producers and reaped huge profits when the george w. bush administration imposed a 30 percent tariff on steel imports in march 2002. his newly formed international steel group went public the next year and was acquired by luxembourg giant arcelormittal in 2005. ross\xe2\x80\x99 firm went on to invest in other struggling american industries including textiles in the south and coal in appalachia. ross gained a reputation as a financier who breathed life into industries others had left for dead. but he has been criticized for moving american jobs overseas to improve profits. a reuters\xe2\x80\x99 analysis of u.s. labor department statistics found that ross takeovers resulted in the loss of 2700 u.s. jobs in auto parts mortgage finance and textiles by shifting production abroad benefiting mexico india china and nicaragua among other countries. his private equity firm has also run afoul of securities regulations that require full and candid disclosure in dealings with investors. in august 2016 the sec announced an enforcement action against wl ross &  co. for overcharging investors by changing the formula for calculating management fees without telling them. without admitting or denying wrongdoing wl ross agreed to pay $10.4 million in restitution to investors and $2.3 million in civil penalties. over the years ross has climbed into the ranks of america\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest individuals with a fortune estimated by forbes in september 2017 at $2.5 billion. he and his wife hilary geary ross have a palm beach villa down the road from trump\xe2\x80\x99s mar-a-lago resort in florida another house in southampton n.y. and a third home in manhattan. they also own an art collection with a value that bloomberg has estimated at $250 million including paintings by the surrealist rene magritte valued at $100 million. ross was also leader \xe2\x80\x93 known as the grand swipe \xe2\x80\x93 of a secret wall street fraternity called kappa beta phi and in 2012 presided over an annual ceremony in which initiates performed song-and-dance routines in drag during a feast of lamb and foie gras at a manhattan hotel. ross has dismissed the idea that the very wealthiest have unfair advantages arguing in 2014 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe 1 percent is being picked on for political reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d he added \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9ceducation is the way that people get out of the ghetto and into if not the 1 percent something close to it.\xe2\x80\x9d trump said he nominated ross because he admires his wealth and ferocious drive. \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x99d like to put on a guy that failed all his life but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want that do we \xe2\x80\x9d trump said at a post-election victory rally in ohio. \xe2\x80\x9cno i put on a killer.\xe2\x80\x9d as it expanded wl ross &  co. set up an increasing number of entities in offshore tax havens many in the cayman islands. the british territory in the caribbean levies no corporate or income tax on money earned outside the jurisdiction and requires little disclosure of corporate ownership. this has made the caymans a popular place for u.s. private equity managers to set up their funds. appleby has been a key adviser and service provider. the global offshore law firm has administered more than 50 cayman island companies for wl ross &  co. the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s records show. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files for instance include a group of five cayman islands companies whose names all include \xe2\x80\x9ceuro wagon.\xe2\x80\x9d these companies were used to hold and manage shares of vtg the german rail car and logistics company that wl ross &  co. acquired in 2005 and that later expanded into eastern europe and russia. appleby hosted and wooed wl ross &  co. executives at such events as the u.s. open tennis tournament and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164176-email-ky-entities.html">employees congratulated one another</a> as the relationship grew. the law firm reduced due diligence requirements for the ross-related companies by designating them low-risk and therefore qualified for decreased scrutiny under cayman laws regulating law firms\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to investigate clients. \xe2\x80\x9cthis is absolutely fantastic sabine\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164183-email-due-diligence.html">wrote appleby attorney matthew taber</a> when compliance officer sabine calvetti broke the news about the need for less scrutiny. \xe2\x80\x9c100 percent spot on and really great work.\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014 the ross group was one of appleby\xe2\x80\x99s top 20 clients based on the number of companies administered. appleby\xe2\x80\x99s files show the four companies ross retained in two parallel chains of ownership with ross at the top. according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4164158-ross-ownership.html">appleby records</a> ross is a shareholder and was a director of two companies established in july 2011 as general partners to control two other wl ross &  co entities that invested in the shipping industry which in turn control two wl ross group funds. these funds invested in several shipping companies including navigator according to sec filings and ross\xe2\x80\x99 ethics disclosures. ross\xe2\x80\x99s former firm wl ross &  co. is navigator\xe2\x80\x99s largest shareholder owning 39.4 percent of navigator through companies it controls. after he became commerce secretary ross kept a personal financial interest in some of those entities but resigned from managing them. those in which he retained a stake account for four-fifths of the overall 39.4 percent. federal ethics law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters that would have \xe2\x80\x9ca direct and predictable\xe2\x80\x9d effect on the official\xe2\x80\x99s or a family member\xe2\x80\x99s financial interest. recusal is also required if the official has a close relationship that might cause a reasonable person to doubt the official\xe2\x80\x99s impartiality. during his confirmation hearings ross sought to reassure senators that he would avoid conflicts of interest between his business holdings and his cabinet post. \xe2\x80\x9ci intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\xe2\x80\x9d he said  contributors to this story: <a
