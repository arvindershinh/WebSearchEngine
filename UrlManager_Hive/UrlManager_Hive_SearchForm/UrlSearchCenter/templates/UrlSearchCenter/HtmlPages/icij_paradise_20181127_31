in which an action causes an event which in turn causes a second event &#8211; as long as the causal relationship between the official\xe2\x80\x99s action and its financial effect is clear. ross negotiated the china agreement with his chief-of-staff wendy teramoto. teramoto who was ross\xe2\x80\x99 deputy at his private equity firm wl ross &  co. before joining the commerce department still sat on navigator\xe2\x80\x99s board when she first went to work at commerce <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/06/wilbur-ross-commerce-navigator-aide-russia-244608"><span style="font-weight: 400;">politico reported</span></a>. there have also been questions raised about whether ross should be omitted from all international shipping matters. it is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary but not sufficient\xe2\x80\x9d for ross to abstain from international shipping matters clark said. \xe2\x80\x9ci&#8217;d want to look at every matter that he touches as commerce secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d adding to the ethics questions circling ross <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/08/wilbur-ross-paradise-papers-trump-russia/">the intercept also reported</a> last week that the commerce department\xe2\x80\x99s designated ethics official david maggi was promoted to the position by ross. maggi is responsible for conducting oversight of ross\xe2\x80\x99 and teramoto\xe2\x80\x99s conflicts of interest. in response to questions about whether the ethics office has reviewed ross and teramoto\xe2\x80\x99s role in the china trade deal commerce department spokesman james rockas told icij that \xe2\x80\x9clng export policy is not set by the department of commerce. the government of china volunteered an interest in long term lng contracts and secretary ross simply reported the u.s. government\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x9d. rockas also previously told the new york times and icij that ross had not sought ethics waivers that would allow him to take part in matters where there was a conflict of interest. some of these findings were cited in the request by the six senators to the commerce department inspector general which included a call to examine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether secretary ross has complied with the recusal requirements in his ethics agreement and the adequacy of that agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d they also called for the investigation to\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cexamine the veracity of secretary ross\xe2\x80\x99 statements about his wealth\xe2\x80\x9d which have been questioned by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2017/11/07/the-case-of-wilbur-ross-phantom-2-billion/#694b8a4b7515">forbes</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-15/ross-s-net-worth-calculation-cut-to-860-million-by-bloomberg">bloomberg.</a> separately the commerce secretary found himself being sued this week by former colleagues who <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2017/11/15/three-former-colleagues-sue-secretary-of-commerce-wilbur-ross/#14bbb0032b3f">allege ross pocketed millions</a> in improper fees.</div></div>
