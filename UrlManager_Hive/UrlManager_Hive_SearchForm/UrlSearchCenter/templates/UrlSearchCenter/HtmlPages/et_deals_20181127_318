<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>mumbai: mahindra & mahindra said on wednesday it agreed to acquire turkey’s fourth-largest tractor manufacturer  erkunt traktor sanayii  and an associate company for an enterprise value of $117 million (rs 735 crore).mahindra will acquire 100% of tractor making operations from the armagan family for $76 million (`478 crore). in erkunt sanayi  the foundry business which provides castings to machining services  the indian company will buy between an 80% and 100% stake for $41million (rs 257 crore). the armagan family holds 35% of the foundry business.mahindra  the world’s largest tractor maker by volume  has been courting erkunt for three years. the acquisition will allow the company to participate more actively in the $3.5-billion farm equipment market of turkey.this is mahindra’s second acquisition in turkey. it had taken over hisarlar  a tractor implement specialist  in early 2017. with 70% of the market being dominated by local players in turkey  mahindra’s rationale is to be local with a local supply chain. much like its previous acquisitions  mahindra will allow the current management at erkunt to run the show  but have a strong representation on its board. mahindra will act more as a guiding force instead of executing plans. managing director pawan goenka told et that with the acquisition of erkunt  mahindra has traversed two-thirds distance in its vision of generating half its farm equipment business from global operations. “turkey is a very strategic market. it is not only the fourth largest tractor market in the world  but the customer also demands the same range of tractors that mahindra deals in. the only way to tap into this large market was to have a local presence and the acquisition made more sense ” goenka said. global operations currently account for almost 35% of the company’s $3.5-billion farm equipment business.the last three to four acquisitions made by mahindra in the farm equipment space over two years have added $700-800 million to the turnover.the acquisition offers mahindra a brand that is strong locally with a wide product portfolio and dealer network in turkey. the availability of a homologated product range  dedicated export brand  access to manufacturing capacity and vendor base in turkey were big pluses behind taking over erkunt. the indian company intends to use erkunt as a beachhead to enter the middle east  cis and north african markets. erkunt  incorporated in 2003  has a market share of 6% in turkey  with tractors in the 55-110 hp range.the turkish company had generated revenue of $88 million in 2016  selling around 4 700 tractors. exports constituted around 7% of sales. the company has its production facility in ankara and employs 355 people. it is supported by a distribution network of 95 dealers and 326 authorised service locations. the foundry unit focuses on engine blocks  cylinder heads and transmission cases and has a customer portfolio that includes jcb  man  ford and deutz.</div></div>
