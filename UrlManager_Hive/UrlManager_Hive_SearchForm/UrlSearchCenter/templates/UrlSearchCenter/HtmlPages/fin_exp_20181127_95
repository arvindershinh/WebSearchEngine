<div><div><h2>Indian American Thomas Kurian is new Google Cloud chief</h2></div><div>google cloud chief executive officer diane greene who has pushed for three years to catch up with market leaders amazon.com inc. and microsoft corp. will step down from her post and be succeeded by former oracle corp. executive thomas kurian. greene 63 will remain ceo through january working with kurian who will join the alphabet inc. unit nov. 26. greene said in a blog post that she will stay as an alphabet board member. during her tenure in charge of one of the internet giant\u2019s central units greene rapidly expanded the business hiring a major new salesforce and investing hundreds of millions of dollars in data centers and undersea cables. still google cloud is seen by analysts as a distant third in the u.s. to amazon and microsoft in the market for running apps and storing data in the cloud despite having a head-start on microsoft that predated greene\u2019s time at the company. her management also spurred questions from some employees about google\u2019s work for the u.s. government. the company retracted its bid for a multibillion cloud-computing contract with the pentagon amid worker protests over google\u2019s support for the u.s. military. greene is one of google\u2019s most prominent female executives. her departure highlights the gender imbalance in the management ranks of a company that is grappling with criticism over how it has treated its female employees especially in regards to sexual harassment. greene said she plans to turn her attention to mentoring and education. before joining google she was a founding member and eventual ceo of software company vmware which emc corp. bought in 2004 and is now part of dell technologies inc. in her blog post greene praised her staff for boosting google\u2019s business. \u201cthe cloud space is early and there is an enormous opportunity ahead\u201d she said. still greene\u2019s time at google didn\u2019t include the kind of major acquisition that some analysts said would have narrowed the competitive gap with microsoft and amazon. greene said in a march interview that she was prepared to make a big purchase to catch up to the industry leaders. since then two notable transactions were made and neither of them by google cloud - to the surprise of some in the industry. in june microsoft agreed to buy github inc. whose tools are used by developers to collaborate on and store computer code for $7.5 billion. google cloud executives had indicated that they would\u2019ve liked to own github but they didn\u2019t have signoff from alphabet\u2019s board to write the check people familiar with the matter said. in october ibm bought open-source software company red hat for $33 billion - the world\u2019s second-largest technology deal ever - and another purchase that analysts said could have seen interest from google. the company had early-stage talks with red hat in 2017 but didn\u2019t proceed further said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations. with kurian google will be getting an executive who used to supervise cloud development at oracle the world\u2019s second-largest software maker. kurian had a difficult time transitioning the company to cloud computing. after years of effort oracle struggled to gain much traction against amazon web services and microsoft\u2019s azure. he\u2019ll now have a chance to try it again. kurian spent 22 years at oracle where he grew into a powerful acolyte of executive chairman larry ellison. people familiar with kurian\u2019s time at oracle said he adheres to a top-down model of management which may be at odds with google\u2019s more collaborative work environment. he was also known to clash with some of his subordinates and have teams jostle for resources at oracle said the people who asked not to be named discussing internal issues. kurian didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. kurian climbed through the ranks of the software maker by spearheading products that accelerated sales growth such as middleware but got his start as a consultant at mckinsey & co. he was said to have disagreed with ellison on the direction of oracle\u2019s cloud business bloomberg reported in september leading to kurian\u2019s leave of absence and eventual resignation from the company\u2019s fourth-highest role in september.</div></div>
