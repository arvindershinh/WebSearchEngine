<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>for india's commercial real estate  which is reviving after around four years of downturn  the concept of co-working spaces  popular across many countries  is attracting businesses and is growing in demand.a co-working space  as the name suggests  refers to an office area where a number of organisations work out of a shared space or floor  contrary to the conventional office area where a particular space is leased out or used by a single organisation. it also provides its members flexibility of space or desks as per its requirement and all the logistical amenities are taken care of by the space provider.the price per seat in a co-working space varies from as low as rs 5 000 per month to premium slots going for rs 35 000 per month  depending upon the operator and the market dynamics.there are over 600 shared workspaces with over 1.80 lakh seats across the country. area under co-working spaces is currently around 13.5 million square feet  data from consultancy firm cbre showed.in the overall office market space  co-working spaces have seen a rise in demand  especially among start-ups  anshuman magazine  chairman  india and south east asia  cbre  told ians."while co-working companies took up a modest 0.17 million square metres (1.8 million square feet) in 2017  the first quarter of 2018 itself has exceeded the annual tally of 2017 at 0.19 million square metres (2 million square feet) " according to a knight frank report.quoting the cbre's india office market view  q2 2018 report  magazine said: "the share of co-working or business center operators doubled from just five per cent in h1 (january-june) 2017 to about 10 per cent in the review period."in terms of investment in the last financial year  viral desai  national director for occupier solutions at knight frank india  said: "i would say last year around two million square feet would have been signed up. in terms of investment  it could be around rs 2 000-3 000 per square feet on setting it out."according to market participants  space-takers in the segment range from start-ups to big corporations; however  start-ups and small corporations form a major part. market players say the rise in interest comes on the back of perks such as cost-effective and flexible leasing terms and hassle-free operations  among others.the major sector players in india are regus  wework  cowrks  awfis and smartworks and  according to the consultancy firm knight frank  they have 8.5 million square feet of operational space  with plans for an additional seven million square feet by 2020. currently  delhi-ncr  mumbai and bengaluru house most of the co-working stock in india  followed by pune and kolkata.talking of the convenience offered to the consumers  ryan bennet  chief wework officer  wework india  said: "it is a segment where you don't have to put down a 10-month security deposit... you don't have to put in any capital investment."you just have to show up on day one with your computers in hand and everything is taken care of for you " he said. wework india is a joint venture of us-based wework and the embassy group.normally  when an organisation signs up for a commercial lease in traditional real estate  it gets locked in for 5 to 10 years  allowing limited flexibility  while co-working spaces give the flexibility to scale up and scale down the space and occupancy duration as the need arises  bennet added.he was of the opinion that  on an average  a company would save 15-20 per cent annually while working out of a co-working space compared to the cost incurred in traditional office area.along with domestic companies  the demand from foreign firms also is palpable  according to space providers.shouvik mandal  director of apeejay business centre  said: "foreign players also face restrictions in buying property... which further attracts them towards co-working spaces."apart from it and other logistical support  many space providers also provide other amenities and facilities ranging from community meetings  food programmes  knowledge sharing sessions and so on  which sets them apart from the conventional office space providers.karanpal singh  founder of the circle  which recently launched its first co-working centre at the huda city centre metro station  gurugram said: "today the millennials want a good environment to work in  just as much as a good company to work in."talking of the designing aspect  yash kela  founder of interior designing firm arrivae  said that corporate offices are more formal and hierarchy-driven spaces while co-working spaces are more vibrant  casual spaces. community areas like balconies or terraces are the primary areas where employees can interact and discuss."overall  the two categories are the complete opposite. corporates tend to attract an older age group whereas co-working spaces are catered for start-ups where the age groups are way more younger " he said.regarding competition between the conventional office space and co-working facilities  people in the market say that  for conventional spaces  the competition is not of much concern; in fact  both could prove to be complementary to each other."these two will basically make up for each other " said mandal  who also heads the firm  apeejay real estate. small firms which take up spaces business centres and would move out to a conventional office space in the long run when they grow and the number of employees increases  he added.the concept of co-working spaces has so far been largely limited to the tier-i cities. although business centers have cropped up in few tier-ii cities  the popularity there is yet to pick up  market players said.on the outlook for the market  sector players said the market seems positive and demand would increase from here on."in india it will expand faster than a lot of other markets  because you have 600 million (people) under the age of 35  a strong gdp growth of over 7 per cent " bennet said. the circle's singh said  "it's only the beginning  and co-working is the largest growing market right now."</div></div>
