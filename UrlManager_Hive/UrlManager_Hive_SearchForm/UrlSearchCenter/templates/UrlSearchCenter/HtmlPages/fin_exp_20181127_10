<div><div><h2>IL&FS defaults on Rs 307-cr deposits from MUDRA due on November 17</h2></div><div>il&fs (infrastructure leasing & financial services) on monday said it has defaulted on principal and interest of over rs 307 crore with respect to deposits from mudra (micro units development & refinance agency) due on november 17 2018. last week the firm had said it had defaulted on a repayment of rs 31 lakh due on november 8. il&fs and its numerous subsidiaries have defaulted on multiple repayments so far. on october 23 the company in an exchange filing said that it defaulted on rs 348 crore of debt that was due in three separate repayments on october 19 20 and 22 taking the total amount in missed repayments to rs 4272 crore. later on thursday il&fs energy development company (iedcl) said it has defaulted on interest repayments of rs 4.66 crore on non-convertible debentures (ncd). the interest repayments were due starting august 15 till november 14. according to data compiled from prime database and value research il&fs has a repayment of rs 141 crore coming up on november 27 to tata mutual fund. it also needs to pay a total of rs 185 crore in december on bonds and ncds. between now and march 2019 il&fs needs to repay slightly over rs 1500 crore in ncds bonds and commercial paper. meanwhile lenders to il&fs have opposed the 90-day moratorium sought by the ministry of corporate affairs (mca) on creditor proceedings for loans taken by the company and its subsidiaries. last week in a hearing at the national company law appellate tribunal (nclat) lenders asked the appellate tribunal to also allow them not to classify il&fs account as a non-performing asset (npa) in case of non-payment. the government has sought the moratorium to help a resolution plan to take shape so that il&fs can pay off its debts. the next hearing on the issue is set for december 17. on october 31 the uday kotak-led board proposed a three-pronged strategy to revive il&fs. the strategy includes capital infusion at the group level sale of subsidiaries at the vertical level and resolution at the asset level. the report submitted to the national company law tribunal (nclt) said that the board would work towards the final resolution in stages and parts over the next six-nine months.</div></div>
