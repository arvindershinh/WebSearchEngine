<div><div><h2>--</h2></div><div>tyremaker ceat did away with the policy of attendance recording system three months ago  allowing employees to enter and leave office at a flexible time.the traditional manufacturing firm  a part of industrial conglomerate rpg enterprises  has introduced work from remote location— which could be home  a café or a mall or anywhere—in an initiative to give more flexibility and create an environment in sync with the new world around.the new flexible system  led by its young md and rpg scion anant goenka  assesses employees purely on deliverables—a rare thing for an indian company and that too a manufacturing company.while ceat has gone aggressive with its flexibility policies more in tune with global mncs  an increasing number of mature indian companies are opening up to the idea of flexibility as well as working from remote locations in a bid to attract and retain new generation employees in the workforce.companies like mahindra  tata motors  cipla and godrej are creating a system that allows more flexibility and freedom to the employees.“indian firms are progressively getting more flexible with workplace practices  responding to the preferences of the new talent demographics ” said prabir jha  global chief people officer  cipla.“at ceat  we go with trust and empowerment. our office opens at 7am and shuts at 9pm. employees can choose their time ” said milind apte  head human resources  ceat  which has done away with the policy of the 8-9 hours man day and made attendance recording system defunct. “there is no minimum work hour a day. employees are purely judged by delivery ” said apte.tata motors  the country’s leading vehicle maker  has made work-from-home applicable at all its offices where employees can avail the option for continuous two days every week. if needed  in certain cases  it can be extended in consultation with the line manager.meetings can be over phones or recently introduced business skype and people can log in from anywhere. “it is found to be very helpful for new parents or to take care of someone at home when one can save a lot of time travelling ” said gajendra chandel  chief human resources officer  tata motors. “we do not have strict punch in and punch out time. we assess employees on the basis of deliverables ” he said  adding this has a lot of trust element. “you don’t know what the individual might be doing (working remotely).we have found some misuses too  when the individual is called up and counselled. but overall the flexibility has been helpful ” he added.icici bank has an iwork@home policy that involves a facial recognition technology to ensure that no one can impersonate the employee and get access to applications.the policy  which initially allowed women employees to work from home for longer periods of time  up to a year and beyond  has now been extended for all employees.drugmaker cipla offers employees flexibility to walk in anytime within a two-hour window in the morning in mumbai. this helps employees choose the eight-hour window they wish to be in office.“this has only enabled productivity as employees get to choose the hours each day based on his/her priorities both professionally and personally ” said jha.fmcg major godrej has a six-hour a day in office policy while rest of the time is flexible with an option to work from home two days a month. adhesives maker pidilite has flexi in and out timings.the most recent change was to give employees the flexibility to complete their work hours on a weekly basis instead of a day count. “the bulk of our employees avail the facility ” said rahul sinha  president  hr  pidilite industries.technology is the biggest enabler in this transformation  where one can work remotely using smart phones  telepresence and skype that enable connectivity anytime and from any location.hr heads agree that a personal meeting is still not out of fashion  but advancement in technology is fast filling the gap where teams across locations and geographies can connect virtually.“face time is important  as without the human touch and team work  getting work could be difficult ” said prince augustin  executive vice president  group human capital and leadership  mahindra & mahindra.however  he added: “the technology landscape could fill this gap and with teams across geographies  virtual connect has become a reality and face time therefore is more technology-enabled.” there is need for a shift in mind sets too  particularly in large indian organisations that are used to a hierarchical operating structure  hr heads said.at godrej for instance  the senior management is leading the way to break the stereotypes.“many of our senior leaders use the work-from-home option and share their experiences on workplace (formerly known as facebook for business). this has helped break stereotypes and has encouraged all our team members to consider the option guilt-free  without the fear of being criticised or judged ” said sumit mitra  head- group hr and corporate services  godrej industries limited and associate companies.</div></div>
